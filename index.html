          <h1>Preface</h1>
          <p>
            In order to draw things in 2D, we usually rely on lines, which
            typically get classified into two categories: straight lines, and
            curves. The first of these are as easy to draw as they are easy to
            make a computer draw. Give a computer the first and last point in
            the line, and BAM! straight line. No questions asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Curves, however, are a much bigger problem. While we can draw curves
            with ridiculous ease freehand, computers are a bit handicapped in
            that they can't draw curves unless there is a mathematical function
            that describes how it should be drawn. In fact, they even need this
            for straight lines, but the function is ridiculously easy, so we
            tend to ignore that as far as computers are concerned; all lines are
            "functions", regardless of whether they're straight or curves.
            However, that does mean that we need to come up with fast-to-compute
            functions that lead to nice looking curves on a computer. There are
            a number of these, and in this article we'll focus on a particular
            function that has received quite a bit of attention and is used in
            pretty much anything that can draw curves: Bézier curves.
          </p>
          <p>
            They're named after
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_B%C3%A9zier"
              >Pierre Bézier</a
            >, who is principally responsible for making them known to the world
            as a curve well-suited for design work (publishing his
            investigations in 1962 while working for Renault), although he was
            not the first, or only one, to "invent" these type of curves. One
            might be tempted to say that the mathematician
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_de_Casteljau"
              >Paul de Casteljau</a
            >
            was first, as he began investigating the nature of these curves in
            1959 while working at Citroën, and came up with a really elegant way
            of figuring out how to draw them. However, de Casteljau did not
            publish his work, making the question "who was first" hard to answer
            in any absolute sense. Or is it? Bézier curves are, at their core,
            "Bernstein polynomials", a family of mathematical functions
            investigated by
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Natanovich_Bernstein"
              >Sergei Natanovich Bernstein</a
            >, whose publications on them date back at least as far as 1912.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, that's mostly trivia, what you are more likely to care about
            is that these curves are handy: you can link up multiple Bézier
            curves so that the combination looks like a single curve. If you've
            ever drawn Photoshop "paths" or worked with vector drawing programs
            like Flash, Illustrator or Inkscape, those curves you've been
            drawing are Bézier curves.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what if you need to program them yourself? What are the
            pitfalls? How do you draw them? What are the bounding boxes, how do
            you determine intersections, how can you extrude a curve, in short:
            how do you do everything that you might want when you do with these
            curves? That's what this page is for. Prepare to be mathed!

            <h2>PS: buy me a coffee?</h2>
            <p>
              If you enjoyed this book enough to print it out, you might be
              wondering if there is some way to give something back. To answer
              that question: you can always buy me a coffee, however-much a
              coffee is where you live. Or, if you want to pay a fair price for
              this book, you can buy me a really expensive coffee =)
            </p>
            <p>
              This book has grown over the years from a short primer to a 100+
              print-page-equivalent ebook on the subject of Bézier curves, and a
              lot of coffee went into the making of it. I don't regret a minute
              I spent on writing it, but I can always do with some more coffee
              to keep on writing! Please visit
              <a href="https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo"
                >https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo</a
              >
              and click on the link in the "Help support the book" preface
              section to donate some coffee money.

            <h2>Virtually all Bézier graphics are interactive.</h2>
            <p>
              This page uses interactive examples, relying heavily on
              <a href="http://pomax.github.io/bezierjs">Bezier.js</a>, as well
              as maths formulae which are typeset into SVG using the
              <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/xetex">XeLaTeX</a> typesetting

            <h2>This book is open source.</h2>
            <p>
              This book is an open source software project, and lives on two
              github repositories. The first is
              <a href="https://github.com/pomax/bezierinfo"
                >https://github.com/pomax/bezierinfo</a
              >
              and is the purely-for-presentation version you are viewing right
              now. The other repository is
              <a href="https://github.com/pomax/BezierInfo-2"
                >https://github.com/pomax/BezierInfo-2</a
              >, which is the development version, housing all the HTML,
              JavaScript, and CSS. You can fork either of these, and pretty much
              do with them as you please, except for passing it off as your own
              work wholesale, of course =)
            </p>
            <h2>How complicated is the maths going to be?</h2>
            <p>
              Most of the mathematics in this Primer are early high school
              maths. If you understand basic arithmetic, and you know how to
              read English, you should be able to get by just fine. There will
              at times be <em>far</em> more complicated maths, but if you don't
              feel like digesting them, you can safely skip over them by either
              skipping over the "detail boxes" in section or by just jumping to
              the end of a section with maths that looks too involving. The end
              of sections typically simply list the conclusions so you can just
              work with those values directly.
            </p>
            <h2>Questions, comments:</h2>
            <p>
              If you have suggestions for new sections, hit up the
              <a href="https://github.com/pomax/BezierInfo-2/issues"
                >Github issue tracker</a
              >
              (also reachable from the repo linked to in the upper right). If
              you have questions about the material, there's currently no
              comment section while I'm doing the rewrite, but you can use the
              issue tracker for that as well. Once the rewrite is done, I'll add
              a general comment section back in, and maybe a more topical
              "select this section of text and hit the 'question' button to ask
              a question about it" system. We'll see.

            Let's start with the good stuff: when we're talking about Bézier
            curves, we're talking about the things that you can see in the
            following graphics. They run from some start point to some end
            point, with their curvature influenced by one or more "intermediate"
            control points. Now, because all the graphics on this page are
            interactive, go manipulate those curves a bit: click-drag the
            points, and see how their shape changes based on what you do.

            These curves are used a lot in computer aided design and computer
            aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) applications, as well as in graphic
            design programs like Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, Inkscape,
            GIMP, etc. and in graphic technologies like scalable vector graphics
            (SVG) and OpenType fonts (TTF/OTF). A lot of things use Bézier
            curves, so if you want to learn more about them... prepare to get
            your learn on!

          <h1><a href="#whatis">So what makes a Bézier Curve?</a></h1>
          <p>
            Playing with the points for curves may have given you a feel for how
            Bézier curves behave, but what <em>are</em> Bézier curves, really?
            There are two ways to explain what a Bézier curve is, and they turn
            out to be the entirely equivalent, but one of them uses complicated
            maths, and the other uses really simple maths. So... let's start
            with the simple explanation:
          </p>
          <p>
            Bézier curves are the result of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation"
              >linear interpolations</a
            >. That sounds complicated but you've been doing linear
            interpolation since you were very young: any time you had to point
            at something between two other things, you've been applying linear
            interpolation. It's simply "picking a point between two points".
          </p>
          <p>
            If we know the distance between those two points, and we want a new
            point that is, say, 20% the distance away from the first point (and
            thus 80% the distance away from the second point) then we can
            compute that really easily:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/b5aa26284ba3df74970a95cb047a841d.svg"
            width="501px"
            height="103px"
          />
          <p>
            So let's look at that in action: the following graphic is
            interactive in that you can use your up and down arrow keys to
            increase or decrease the interpolation ratio, to see what happens.
            We start with three points, which gives us two lines. Linear
            interpolation over those lines gives us two points, between which we
            can again perform linear interpolation, yielding a single point. And
            that point —and all points we can form in this way for all ratios
            taken together— form our Bézier curve:

          <p>And that brings us to the complicated maths: calculus.</p>
          <p>
            While it doesn't look like that's what we've just done, we actually
            just drew a quadratic curve, in steps, rather than in a single go.
            One of the fascinating parts about Bézier curves is that they can
            both be described in terms of polynomial functions, as well as in
            terms of very simple interpolations of interpolations of [...].
            That, in turn, means we can look at what these curves can do based
            on both "real maths" (by examining the functions, their derivatives,
            and all that stuff), as well as by looking at the "mechanical"
            composition (which tells us, for instance, that a curve will never
            extend beyond the points we used to construct it).
          </p>
          <p>
            So let's start looking at Bézier curves a bit more in depth: their
            mathematical expressions, the properties we can derive from them,
            and the various things we can do to, and with, Bézier curves.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="explanation">
          <h1><a href="#explanation">The mathematics of Bézier curves</a></h1>
          <p>
            Bézier curves are a form of "parametric" function. Mathematically
            speaking, parametric functions are cheats: a "function" is actually
            a well defined term representing a mapping from any number of inputs
            to a <strong>single</strong> output. Numbers go in, a single number
            comes out. Change the numbers that go in, and the number that comes
            out is still a single number.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parametric functions cheat. They basically say "alright, well, we
            want multiple values coming out, so we'll just use more than one
            function". An illustration: Let's say we have a function that maps
            some value, let's call it <i>x</i>, to some other value, using some
            kind of number manipulation:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/1caef9931f954e32eae5067b732c1018.svg"
            width="96px"
            height="17px"
          />
          <p>
            The notation <i>f(x)</i> is the standard way to show that it's a
            function (by convention called <i>f</i> if we're only listing one)
            and its output changes based on one variable (in this case,
            <i>x</i>). Change <i>x</i>, and the output for <i>f(x)</i> changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            So far, so good. Now, let's look at parametric functions, and how
            they cheat. Let's take the following two functions:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/0f5cffd58e864fec6739a57664eb8cbd.svg"
            width="93px"
            height="36px"
          />
          <p>
            There's nothing really remarkable about them, they're just a sine
            and cosine function, but you'll notice the inputs have different
            names. If we change the value for <i>a</i>, we're not going to
            change the output value for <i>f(b)</i>, since <i>a</i> isn't used
            in that function. Parametric functions cheat by changing that. In a
            parametric function all the different functions share a variable,
            like this:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/066a910ae6aba69c40a338320759cdd1.svg"
            width="100px"
            height="40px"
          />
          <p>
            Multiple functions, but only one variable. If we change the value
            for <i>t</i>, we change the outcome of both
            <i>f<sub>a</sub>(t)</i> and <i>f<sub>b</sub>(t)</i>. You might
            wonder how that's useful, and the answer is actually pretty simple:
            if we change the labels <i>f<sub>a</sub>(t)</i> and
            <i>f<sub>b</sub>(t)</i> with what we usually mean with them for
            parametric curves, things might be a lot more obvious:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/4cf6fb369841e2c5d36e5567a8db4306.svg"
            width="77px"
            height="40px"
          />
          <p>
            There we go. <i>x</i>/<i>y</i> coordinates, linked through some
            mystery value <i>t</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, parametric curves don't define a <i>y</i> coordinate in terms of
            an <i>x</i> coordinate, like normal functions do, but they instead
            link the values to a "control" variable. If we vary the value of
            <i>t</i>, then with every change we get <strong>two</strong> values,
            which we can use as (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) coordinates in a graph. The
            above set of functions, for instance, generates points on a circle:
            We can range <i>t</i> from negative to positive infinity, and the
            resulting (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) coordinates will always lie on a
            circle with radius 1 around the origin (0,0). If we plot it for
            <i>t</i> from 0 to 5, we get this (use your up and down arrow keys
            to change the plot end value):

          <p>
            Bézier curves are just one out of the many classes of parametric
            functions, and are characterised by using the same base function for
            all of the output values. In the example we saw above, the
            <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> values were generated by different functions
            (one uses a sine, the other a cosine); but Bézier curves use the
            "binomial polynomial" for both the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> outputs. So
            what are binomial polynomials?
          </p>
          <p>
            You may remember polynomials from high school. They're those sums
            that look like this:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"

            width="213px"
            height="20px"
          />
          <p>
            If the highest order term they have is <i>x³</i>, they're called
            "cubic" polynomials; if it's <i>x²</i>, it's a "square" polynomial;
            if it's just <i>x</i>, it's a line (and if there aren't even any
            terms with <i>x</i> it's not a polynomial!)
          </p>
          <p>
            Bézier curves are polynomials of <i>t</i>, rather than <i>x</i>,
            with the value for <i>t</i> being fixed between 0 and 1, with
            coefficients <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> etc. taking the "binomial" form,
            which sounds fancy but is actually a pretty simple description for
            mixing values:

            I know what you're thinking: that doesn't look too simple! But if we
            remove <i>t</i> and add in "times one", things suddenly look pretty
            easy. Check out these binomial terms:

            Notice that 2 is the same as 1+1, and 3 is 2+1 and 1+2, and 6 is
            3+3... As you can see, each time we go up a dimension, we simply
            start and end with 1, and everything in between is just "the two
            numbers above it, added together", giving us a simple number
            sequence known as
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle"
              >Pascal's triangle</a
            >. Now <i>that's</i> easy to remember.
          </p>
          <p>
            There's an equally simple way to figure out how the polynomial terms
            work: if we rename <i>(1-t)</i> to <i>a</i> and <i>t</i> to
            <i>b</i>, and remove the weights for a moment, we get this:
          </p>

            height="60px"
          />
          <p>
            It's basically just a sum of "every combination of <i>a</i> and
            <i>b</i>", progressively replacing <i>a</i>'s with <i>b</i>'s after
            every + sign. So that's actually pretty simple too. So now you know
            binomial polynomials, and just for completeness I'm going to show
            you the generic function for this:

            <h3>How to implement the basis function</h3>
            <p>
              We could naively implement the basis function as a mathematical
              construct, using the function as our guide, like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code>function Bezier(n,t):
  sum = 0
  for(k=0; k&lt;n; k++):
    sum += n!/(k!*(n-k)!) * (1-t)^(n-k) * t^(k)
  return sum</code></pre>
            <p>
              I say we could, because we're not going to: the factorial function
              is <em>incredibly</em> expensive. And, as we can see from the
              above explanation, we can actually create Pascal's triangle quite
              easily without it: just start at [1], then [1,1], then [1,2,1],
              then [1,3,3,1], and so on, with each next row fitting 1 more
              number than the previous row, starting and ending with "1", with
              all the numbers in between being the sum of the previous row's
              elements on either side "above" the one we're computing.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can generate this as a list of lists lightning fast, and then
              never have to compute the binomial terms because we have a lookup
              table:
            </p>
            <pre><code>lut = [      [1],           // n=0
            [1,1],          // n=1
           [1,2,1],         // n=2
          [1,3,3,1],        // n=3
         [1,4,6,4,1],       // n=4
        [1,5,10,10,5,1],    // n=5
       [1,6,15,20,15,6,1]]  // n=6

function binomial(n,k):
  while(n &gt;= lut.length):
    s = lut.length
    nextRow = new array(size=s+1)
    nextRow[0] = 1
    for(i=1, prev=s-1; i&lt;s; i++):
      nextRow[i] = lut[prev][i-1] + lut[prev][i]
    nextRow[s] = 1
    lut.add(nextRow)
  return lut[n][k]</code></pre>
            <p>
              So what's going on here? First, we declare a lookup table with a
              size that's reasonably large enough to accommodate most lookups.
              Then, we declare a function to get us the values we need, and we
              make sure that if an <i>n/k</i> pair is requested that isn't in
              the LUT yet, we expand it first. Our basis function now looks like
              this:
            </p>
            <pre><code>function Bezier(n,t):
  sum = 0
  for(k=0; k&lt;=n; k++):
    sum += binomial(n,k) * (1-t)^(n-k) * t^(k)
  return sum</code></pre>
            <p>
              Perfect. Of course, we can optimize further. For most computer
              graphics purposes, we don't need arbitrary curves (although we
              will also provide code for arbitrary curves in this primer); we
              need quadratic and cubic curves, and that means we can drastically
              simplify the code:
            </p>
            <pre><code>function Bezier(2,t):
  t2 = t * t
  mt = 1-t
  mt2 = mt * mt
  return mt2 + 2*mt*t + t2

function Bezier(3,t):
  t2 = t * t
  t3 = t2 * t
  mt = 1-t
  mt2 = mt * mt
  mt3 = mt2 * mt
  return mt3 + 3*mt2*t + 3*mt*t2 + t3</code></pre>
            <p>And now we know how to program the basis function. Excellent.</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            So, now we know what the basis function looks like, time to add in
            the magic that makes Bézier curves so special: control points.

          <p>
            Bézier curves are, like all "splines", interpolation functions. This
            means that they take a set of points, and generate values somewhere
            "between" those points. (One of the consequences of this is that
            you'll never be able to generate a point that lies outside the
            outline for the control points, commonly called the "hull" for the
            curve. Useful information!). In fact, we can visualize how each
            point contributes to the value generated by the function, so we can
            see which points are important, where, in the curve.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following graphs show the interpolation functions for quadratic
            and cubic curves, with "S" being the strength of a point's
            contribution to the total sum of the Bézier function. Click-and-drag
            to see the interpolation percentages for each curve-defining point
            at a specific <i>t</i> value.

          <p>
            Also shown is the interpolation function for a 15<sup>th</sup> order
            Bézier function. As you can see, the start and end point contribute
            considerably more to the curve's shape than any other point in the
            control point set.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we want to change the curve, we need to change the weights of
            each point, effectively changing the interpolations. The way to do
            this is about as straightforward as possible: just multiply each
            point with a value that changes its strength. These values are
            conventionally called "weights", and we can add them to our original
            Bézier function:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/14cb9fbbaae9e7d87ae6bef3ea7a782e.svg"
            width="352px"
            height="55px"
          />
          <p>
            That looks complicated, but as it so happens, the "weights" are
            actually just the coordinate values we want our curve to have: for
            an <i>n<sup>th</sup></i> order curve, w<sub>0</sub> is our start
            coordinate, w<sub>n</sub> is our last coordinate, and everything in
            between is a controlling coordinate. Say we want a cubic curve that
            starts at (120,160), is controlled by (35,200) and (220,260) and
            ends at (220,40), we use this Bézier curve:

            What else can we do with Bézier curves? Quite a lot, actually. The

            <h3>How to implement the weighted basis function</h3>
            <p>
              Given that we already know how to implement basis function, adding
              in the control points is remarkably easy:
            </p>
            <pre><code>function Bezier(n,t,w[]):
  sum = 0
  for(k=0; k&lt;=n; k++):
    sum += w[k] * binomial(n,k) * (1-t)^(n-k) * t^(k)
  return sum</code></pre>
            <p>And now for the extremely optimized versions:</p>
            <pre><code>function Bezier(2,t,w[]):
  t2 = t * t
  mt = 1-t
  mt2 = mt * mt
  return w[0]*mt2 + w[1]*2*mt*t + w[2]*t2

function Bezier(3,t,w[]):
  t2 = t * t
  t3 = t2 * t
  mt = 1-t
  mt2 = mt * mt
  mt3 = mt2 * mt
  return w[0]*mt3 + 3*w[1]*mt2*t + 3*w[2]*mt*t2 + w[3]*t3</code></pre>
            <p>And now we know how to program the weighted basis function.</p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section id="weightcontrol">
          <h1>
            <a href="#weightcontrol"
              >Controlling Bézier curvatures, part 2: Rational Béziers</a
            >
          </h1>
          <p>
            We can further control Bézier curves by "rationalising" them: that
            is, adding a "ratio" value in addition to the weight value discussed
            in the previous section, thereby gaining control over "how strongly"
            each coordinate influences the curve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adding these ratio values to the regular Bézier curve function is
            fairly easy. Where the regular function is the following:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/02457b19087540dfb144978419524a85.svg"
            width="276px"
            height="41px"
          />
          <p>The function for rational Bézier curves has two more terms:</p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/3fd61ab3fe88f694e70f61e4f8ea056b.svg"
            width="407px"
            height="48px"
          />
          <p>
            In this, the first new term represents an additional weight for each
            coordinate. For example, if our ratio values are [1, 0.5, 0.5, 1]
            then <code>ratio<sub>0</sub> = 1</code>,
            <code>ratio<sub>1</sub> = 0.5</code>, and so on, and is effectively
            identical as if we were just using different weight. So far, nothing
            too special.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the second new term is what makes the difference: every
            point on the curve isn't just a "double weighted" point, it is a
            <em>fraction</em> of the "doubly weighted" value we compute by
            introducing that ratio. When computing points on the curve, we
            compute the "normal" Bézier value and then <em>divide</em> that by
            the Bézier value for the curve that only uses ratios, not weights.
          </p>
          <p>
            This does something unexpected: it turns our polynomial into
            something that <em>isn't</em> a polynomial anymore. It is now a kind
            of curve that is a super class of the polynomials, and can do some
            really cool things that Bézier curves can't do "on their own", such
            as perfectly describing circles (which we'll see in a later section
            is literally impossible using standard Bézier curves).
          </p>
          <p>
            But the best way to show what this does is to do literally that:
            let's look at the effect of "rationalising" our Bézier curves using
            an interactive graphic for a rationalised curves. The following
            graphic shows the Bézier curve from the previous section, "enriched"
            with ratio factors for each coordinate. The closer to zero we set
            one or more terms, the less relative influence the associated
            coordinate exerts on the curve (and of course the higher we set
            them, the more influence they have). Try to change the values and
            see how it affects what gets drawn:

          <p>
            You can think of the ratio values as each coordinate's "gravity":
            the higher the gravity, the closer to that coordinate the curve will
            want to be. You'll also notice that if you simply increase or
            decrease all the ratios by the same amount, nothing changes... much
            like with gravity, if the relative strengths stay the same, nothing
            really changes. The values define each coordinate's influence
            <em>relative to all other points</em>.

          <h1><a href="#extended">The Bézier interval [0,1]</a></h1>
          <p>
            Now that we know the mathematics behind Bézier curves, there's one
            curious thing that you may have noticed: they always run from
            <code>t=0</code> to <code>t=1</code>. Why that particular interval?
          </p>
          <p>
            It all has to do with how we run from "the start" of our curve to
            "the end" of our curve. If we have a value that is a mixture of two
            other values, then the general formula for this is:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/b80a1cac1f9ec476d6f6646ce0e154e7.svg"
            width="215px"
            height="16px"
          />
          <p>
            The obvious start and end values here need to be
            <code>a=1, b=0</code>, so that the mixed value is 100% value 1, and
            0% value 2, and <code>a=0, b=1</code>, so that the mixed value is 0%
            value 1 and 100% value 2. Additionally, we don't want "a" and "b" to
            be independent: if they are, then we could just pick whatever values
            we like, and end up with a mixed value that is, for example, 100%
            value 1 <strong>and</strong> 100% value 2. In principle that's fine,
            but for Bézier curves we always want mixed values
            <em>between</em> the start and end point, so we need to make sure we
            can never set "a" and "b" to some values that lead to a mix value
            that sums to more than 100%. And that's easy:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/d930dea961b40f4810708bd6746221a2.svg"
            width="215px"
            height="16px"
          />
          <p>
            With this we can guarantee that we never sum above 100%. By
            restricting <code>a</code> to values in the interval [0,1], we will
            always be somewhere between our two values (inclusively), and we
            will always sum to a 100% mix.
          </p>
          <p>
            But... what if we use this form, which is based on the assumption
            that we will only ever use values between 0 and 1, and instead use
            values outside of that interval? Do things go horribly wrong?
            Well... not really, but we get to "see more".
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of Bézier curves, extending the interval simply makes
            our curve "keep going". Bézier curves are simply segments of some
            polynomial curve, so if we pick a wider interval we simply get to
            see more of the curve. So what do they look like?
          </p>
          <p>
            The following two graphics show you Bézier curves rendered "the
            usual way", as well as the curves they "lie on" if we were to extend
            the <code>t</code> values much further. As you can see, there's a
            lot more "shape" hidden in the rest of the curve, and we can model
            those parts by moving the curve points around.

          <p>
            In fact, there are curves used in graphics design and computer
            modelling that do the opposite of Bézier curves; rather than fixing
            the interval, and giving you freedom to choose the coordinates, they
            fix the coordinates, but give you freedom over the interval. A great
            example of this is the
            <a href="http://levien.com/phd/phd.html">"Spiro" curve</a>, which is
            a curve based on part of a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_spiral"
              >Cornu Spiral, also known as Euler's Spiral</a
            >. It's a very aesthetically pleasing curve and you'll find it in
            quite a few graphics packages like
            <a href="https://fontforge.github.io">FontForge</a> and
            <a href="https://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a>. It has even been used
            in font design, for example for the Inconsolata typeface.

          <h1><a href="#matrix">Bézier curvatures as matrix operations</a></h1>
          <p>
            We can also represent Bézier curves as matrix operations, by
            expressing the Bézier formula as a polynomial basis function and a
            coefficients matrix, and the actual coordinates as a matrix. Let's
            look at what this means for the cubic curve, using P<sub>...</sub>
            to refer to coordinate values "in one or more dimensions":
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/5aea6d4d5855135051715fb1cc0ec531.svg"
            width="468px"
            height="20px"
          />
          <p>Disregarding our actual coordinates for a moment, we have:</p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/e524525c62234ce616a1e51c9848c169.svg"
            width="353px"
            height="19px"
          />
          <p>We can write this as a sum of four expressions:</p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/c1f815481ad5132bebc1b1f0a3edf20f.svg"
            width="140px"
            height="75px"
          />
          <p>And we can expand these expressions:</p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/9bc905d79bb22580b8c1cd75a791db73.svg"
            width="397px"
            height="75px"
          />
          <p>Furthermore, we can make all the 1 and 0 factors explicit:</p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/e0d89b48cd11a726c00a2f689d48d57c.svg"
            width="217px"
            height="75px"
          />
          <p>
            And <em>that</em>, we can view as a series of four matrix
            operations:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/6da69918482a0b6b84d90a72dbeae9dd.svg"
            width="607px"
            height="72px"
          />
          <p>If we compact this into a single matrix operation, we get:</p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/e94ae04eb5732c05d38fa1c97a2a25b0.svg"
            width="227px"
            height="72px"
          />
          <p>
            This kind of polynomial basis representation is generally written
            with the bases in increasing order, which means we need to flip our
            <code>t</code> matrix horizontally, and our big "mixing" matrix
            upside down:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/24bdad213879407a35b23c18394293aa.svg"
            width="227px"
            height="72px"
          />
          <p>
            And then finally, we can add in our original coordinates as a single
            third matrix:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/009c671bc526b5d75c30411c3c3a7e91.svg"
            width="323px"
            height="73px"
          />
          <p>
            We can perform the same trick for the quadratic curve, in which case
            we end up with:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/77a11d65d7cffc4b84a85c4bec837792.svg"
            width="263px"
            height="55px"
          />
          <p>
            If we plug in a <code>t</code> value, and then multiply the
            matrices, we will get exactly the same values as when we evaluate
            the original polynomial function, or as when we evaluate the curve
            using progressive linear interpolation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>So: why would we bother with matrices?</strong> Matrix
            representations allow us to discover things about functions that
            would otherwise be hard to tell. It turns out that the curves form
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_matrix"
              >triangular matrices</a
            >, and they have a determinant equal to the product of the actual
            coordinates we use for our curve. It's also invertible, which means
            there's
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix#The_invertible_matrix_theorem"
              >a ton of properties</a
            >
            that are all satisfied. Of course, the main question is "why is this
            useful to us now?", and the answer to that is that it's not
            <em>immediately</em> useful, but you'll be seeing some instances
            where certain curve properties can be either computed via function
            manipulation, or via clever use of matrices, and sometimes the
            matrix approach can be (drastically) faster.
          </p>
          <p>
            So for now, just remember that we can represent curves this way, and
            let's move on.

          <h1><a href="#decasteljau">de Casteljau's algorithm</a></h1>
          <p>
            If we want to draw Bézier curves, we can run through all values of
            <code>t</code> from 0 to 1 and then compute the weighted basis
            function at each value, getting the <code>x/y</code> values we need
            to plot. Unfortunately, the more complex the curve gets, the more
            expensive this computation becomes. Instead, we can use
            <em>de Casteljau's algorithm</em> to draw curves. This is a
            geometric approach to curve drawing, and it's really easy to
            implement. So easy, in fact, you can do it by hand with a pencil and
            ruler.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rather than using our calculus function to find
            <code>x/y</code> values for <code>t</code>, let's do this instead:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              treat <code>t</code> as a ratio (which it is). t=0 is 0% along a
              line, t=1 is 100% along a line.
            </li>
            <li>
              Take all lines between the curve's defining points. For an order
              <code>n</code> curve, that's <code>n</code> lines.
            </li>
            <li>
              Place markers along each of these line, at distance
              <code>t</code>. So if <code>t</code> is 0.2, place the mark at 20%
              from the start, 80% from the end.
            </li>
            <li>
              Now form lines between <code>those</code> points. This gives
              <code>n-1</code> lines.
            </li>
            <li>
              Place markers along each of these line at distance <code>t</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Form lines between <code>those</code> points. This'll be
              <code>n-2</code> lines.
            </li>
            <li>Place markers, form lines, place markers, etc.</li>
            <li>
              Repeat this until you have only one line left. The point
              <code>t</code> on that line coincides with the original curve
              point at <code>t</code>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To see this in action, mouse-over the following sketch. Moving the
            mouse changes which curve point is explicitly evaluated using de
            Casteljau's algorithm, moving the cursor left-to-right (or, of
            course, right-to-left), shows you how a curve is generated using
            this approach.

              Let's just use the algorithm we just specified, and implement
              that:
            </p>
            <pre><code>function drawCurve(points[], t):
  if(points.length==1):
    draw(points[0])
  else:
    newpoints=array(points.size-1)
    for(i=0; i&lt;newpoints.length; i++):
      newpoints[i] = (1-t) * points[i] + t * points[i+1]
    drawCurve(newpoints, t)</code></pre>
            <p>
              And done, that's the algorithm implemented. Except usually you
              don't get the luxury of overloading the "+" operator, so let's
              also give the code for when you need to work with
              <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values:
            </p>
            <pre><code>function drawCurve(points[], t):
  if(points.length==1):
    draw(points[0])
  else:
    newpoints=array(points.size-1)
    for(i=0; i&lt;newpoints.length; i++):
      x = (1-t) * points[i].x + t * points[i+1].x
      y = (1-t) * points[i].y + t * points[i+1].y
      newpoints[i] = new point(x,y)
    drawCurve(newpoints, t)</code></pre>
            <p>
              So what does this do? This draws a point, if the passed list of
              points is only 1 point long. Otherwise it will create a new list
              of points that sit at the <i>t</i> ratios (i.e. the "markers"
              outlined in the above algorithm), and then call the draw function
              for this new list.

          <h1><a href="#flattening">Simplified drawing</a></h1>
          <p>
            We can also simplify the drawing process by "sampling" the curve at
            certain points, and then joining those points up with straight
            lines, a process known as "flattening", as we are reducing a curve
            to a simple sequence of straight, "flat" lines.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can do this is by saying "we want X segments", and then sampling
            the curve at intervals that are spaced such that we end up with the
            number of segments we wanted. The advantage of this method is that
            it's fast: instead of evaluating 100 or even 1000 curve coordinates,
            we can sample a much lower number and still end up with a curve that
            sort-of-kind-of looks good enough. The disadvantage of course is
            that we lose the precision of working with "the real curve", so we
            usually can't use the flattened for for doing true intersection
            detection, or curvature alignment.

          <p>
            Try clicking on the sketch and using your up and down arrow keys to
            lower the number of segments for both the quadratic and cubic curve.
            You'll notice that for certain curvatures, a low number of segments
            works quite well, but for more complex curvatures (try this for the
            cubic curve), a higher number is required to capture the curvature
            changes properly.

            Using de Casteljau's algorithm, we can also find all the points we
            need to split up a Bézier curve into two, smaller curves, which
            taken together form the original curve. When we construct de

            gives us all the points we need to split a curve at that
            <code>t</code> value: one curve is defined by all the inside
            skeleton points found prior to our on-curve point, with the other
            curve being defined by all the inside skeleton points after our
            on-curve point.

            <h3>implementing curve splitting</h3>
            <p>
              We can implement curve splitting by bolting some extra logging
              onto the de Casteljau function:
            </p>
            <pre><code>left=[]
right=[]
function drawCurve(points[], t):
  if(points.length==1):
    left.add(points[0])
    right.add(points[0])
    draw(points[0])
  else:
    newpoints=array(points.size-1)
    for(i=0; i&lt;newpoints.length; i++):
      if(i==0):
        left.add(points[i])
      if(i==newpoints.length-1):
        right.add(points[i+1])
      newpoints[i] = (1-t) * points[i] + t * points[i+1]
    drawCurve(newpoints, t)</code></pre>
            <p>
              After running this function for some value <code>t</code>, the
              <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> arrays will contain all
              the coordinates for two new curves - one to the "left" of our
              <code>t</code> value, the other on the "right". These new curves
              will have the same order as the original curve, and can be
              overlaid exactly on the original curve.

            Another way to split curves is to exploit the matrix representation
            of a Bézier curve. In <a href="#matrix">the section on matrices</a>,
            we saw that we can represent curves as matrix multiplications.
            Specifically, we saw these two forms for the quadratic and cubic

            Let's say we want to split the curve at some point
            <code>t = z</code>, forming two new (obviously smaller) Bézier
            curves. To find the coordinates for these two Bézier curves, we can
            use the matrix representation and some linear algebra. First, we
            separate out the actual "point on the curve" information into a new
            matrix multiplication:

            If we could compact these matrices back to the form
            <strong>[t values] · [Bézier matrix] · [column matrix]</strong>,
            with the first two staying the same, then that column matrix on the
            right would be the coordinates of a new Bézier curve that describes
            the first segment, from <code>t = 0</code> to <code>t = z</code>. As
            it turns out, we can do this quite easily, by exploiting some simple
            rules of linear algebra (and if you don't care about the
            derivations, just skip to the end of the box for the results!).

              We can do this because [<em>M · M<sup>-1</sup></em

              by x/x in calculus: it doesn't do anything to the function, but it
              does allow you to rewrite it to something that may be easier to
              work with, or can be broken up differently. In the same way,
              multiplying our matrix by [<em>M · M<sup>-1</sup></em
              >] has no effect on the total formula, but it does allow us to
              change the matrix sequence [<em>something · M</em>] to a sequence
              [<em>M · something</em>], and that makes a world of difference: if
              we know what [<em>M<sup>-1</sup> · Z · M</em>] is, we can apply
              that to our coordinates, and be left with a proper matrix
              representation of a quadratic Bézier curve (which is [<em
                >T · M · P</em
              >]), with a new set of coordinates that represent the curve from
              <em>t = 0</em> to <em>t = z</em>. So let's get computing:

              <code>t = z</code>, we can keep the first coordinate the same
              (which makes sense), our control point becomes a z-ratio mixture
              of the original control point and the start point, and the new end
              point is a mixture that looks oddly similar to a

              again. We first observe that in the previous calculation, we
              actually evaluated the general interval [0,<code>z</code>]. We
              were able to write it down in a more simple form because of the
              zero, but what we <em>actually</em> evaluated, making the zero
              explicit, was:

              <code>[M · something]</code>:

              <strong><em>Nice</em></strong
              >. We see the same thing as before: we can keep the last
              coordinate the same (which makes sense); our control point becomes
              a z-ratio mixture of the original control point and the end point,
              and the new start point is a mixture that looks oddly similar to a
              bernstein polynomial of degree two, except this time it uses (z-1)
              rather than (1-z). These new coordinates are <em>also</em> really
              easy to compute directly!

            So, using linear algebra rather than de Casteljau's algorithm, we
            have determined that, for any quadratic curve split at some value
            <code>t = z</code>, we get two subcurves that are described as
            Bézier curves with simple-to-derive coordinates:

            We can do the same for cubic curves. However, I'll spare you the
            actual derivation (don't let that stop you from writing that out
            yourself, though) and simply show you the resulting new coordinate
            sets:

            So, looking at our matrices, did we really need to compute the
            second segment matrix? No, we didn't. Actually having one segment's
            matrix means we implicitly have the other: push the values of each
            row in the matrix <strong><em>Q</em></strong> to the right, with
            zeroes getting pushed off the right edge and appearing back on the
            left, and then flip the matrix vertically. Presto, you just
            "calculated" <strong><em>Q'</em></strong
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            Implementing curve splitting this way requires less recursion, and
            is just straight arithmetic with cached values, so can be cheaper on
            systems where recursion is expensive. If you're doing computation
            with devices that are good at matrix multiplication, chopping up a
            Bézier curve with this method will be a lot faster than applying de
            Casteljau.

        <section id="reordering">
          <h1><a href="#reordering">Lowering and elevating curve order</a></h1>
          <p>
            One interesting property of Bézier curves is that an
            <em>n<sup>th</sup></em> order curve can always be perfectly
            represented by an <em>(n+1)<sup>th</sup></em> order curve, by giving
            the higher-order curve specific control points.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we have a curve with three points, then we can create a curve
            with four points that exactly reproduces the original curve. First,
            we give it the same start and end points, and for its two control
            points we pick "1/3<sup>rd</sup> start + 2/3<sup>rd</sup> control"
            and "2/3<sup>rd</sup> control + 1/3<sup>rd</sup> end". Now we have
            exactly the same curve as before, except represented as a cubic
            curve rather than a quadratic curve.
          </p>
          <p>
            The general rule for raising an <em>n<sup>th</sup></em> order curve
            to an <em>(n+1)<sup>th</sup></em> order curve is as follows
            (observing that the start and end weights are the same as the start
            and end weights for the old curve):
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/faf29599c9307f930ec28065c96fde2a.svg"
            width="768px"
            height="61px"
          />
          <p>
            However, this rule also has as direct consequence that you
            <strong>cannot</strong> generally safely lower a curve from
            <em>n<sup>th</sup></em> order to <em>(n-1)<sup>th</sup></em> order,
            because the control points cannot be "pulled apart" cleanly. We can
            try to, but the resulting curve will not be identical to the
            original, and may in fact look completely different.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there is a surprisingly good way to ensure that a lower
            order curve looks "as close as reasonably possible" to the original
            curve: we can optimise the "least-squares distance" between the
            original curve and the lower order curve, in a single operation
            (also explained over on
            <a
              href="http://www.sirver.net/blog/2011/08/23/degree-reduction-of-bezier-curves"
              >Sirver's Castle</a
            >). However, to use it, we'll need to do some calculus work and then
            switch over to linear algebra. As mentioned in the section on matrix
            representations, some things can be done much more easily with
            matrices than with calculus functions, and this is one of those
            things. So... let's go!
          </p>
          <p>
            We start by taking the standard Bézier function, and condensing it a
            little:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/1244a85c1f9044b6f77cb709c682159c.svg"
            width="408px"
            height="41px"
          />
          <p>
            Then, we apply one of those silly (actually, super useful) calculus
            tricks: since our <code>t</code> value is always between zero and
            one (inclusive), we know that <code>(1-t)</code> plus
            <code>t</code> always sums to 1. As such, we can express any value
            as a sum of <code>t</code> and <code>1-t</code>:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/b2fda1dcce5bb13317aa42ebf5e7ea6c.svg"
            width="379px"
            height="16px"
          />
          <p>
            So, with that seemingly trivial observation, we rewrite that Bézier
            function by splitting it up into a sum of a <code>(1-t)</code> and
            <code>t</code> component:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/41e184228d85023abdadd6ce2acb54c7.svg"
            width="316px"
            height="67px"
          />
          <p>
            So far so good. Now, to see why we did this, let's write out the
            <code>(1-t)</code> and <code>t</code> parts, and see what that gives
            us. I promise, it's about to make sense. We start with
            <code>(1-t)</code>:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/4debbed5922d2bd84fd322c616872d20.svg"
            width="387px"
            height="160px"
          />
          <p>
            So by using this seemingly silly trick, we can suddenly express part
            of our n<sup>th</sup> order Bézier function in terms of an (n+1)<sup
              >th</sup
            >
            order Bézier function. And that sounds a lot like raising the curve
            order! Of course we need to be able to repeat that trick for the
            <code>t</code> part, but that's not a problem:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/483c89c8726f7fd0dca0b7de339b04bd.svg"
            width="471px"
            height="159px"
          />
          <p>
            So, with both of those changed from an order
            <code>n</code> expression to an order <code>(n+1)</code> expression,
            we can put them back together again. Now, where the order
            <code>n</code> function had a summation from 0 to <code>n</code>,
            the order <code>n+1</code> function uses a summation from 0 to
            <code>n+1</code>, but this shouldn't be a problem as long as we can
            add some new terms that "contribute nothing". In the next section on
            derivatives, there is a discussion about why "higher terms than
            there is a binomial for" and "lower than zero terms" both
            "contribute nothing". So as long as we can add terms that have the
            same form as the terms we need, we can just include them in the
            summation, they'll sit there and do nothing, and the resulting
            function stays identical to the lower order curve.
          </p>
          <p>Let's do this:</p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/dd8d8d98f66ce9f51b95cbf48225e97b.svg"
            width="465px"
            height="257px"
          />
          <p>
            And this is where we switch over from calculus to linear algebra,
            and matrices: we can now express this relation between Bézier(n,t)
            and Bézier(n+1,t) as a very simple matrix multiplication:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/773fdc86b686647c823b4f499aca3a35.svg"
            width="71px"
            height="16px"
          />
          <p>
            where the matrix <strong>M</strong> is an <code>n+1</code> by
            <code>n</code> matrix, and looks like:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/7a9120997e4a4855ecda435553a7bbdf.svg"
            width="336px"
            height="187px"
          />
          <p>
            That might look unwieldy, but it's really just a mostly-zeroes
            matrix, with a very simply fraction on the diagonal, and an even
            simpler fraction to the left of it. Multiplying a list of
            coordinates with this matrix means we can plug the resulting
            transformed coordinates into the one-order-higher function and get
            an identical looking curve.
          </p>
          <p>Not too bad!</p>
          <p>
            Equally interesting, though, is that with this matrix operation
            established, we can now use an incredibly powerful and ridiculously
            simple way to find out a "best fit" way to reverse the operation,
            called
            <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalEquation.html"
              >the normal equation</a
            >. What it does is minimize the sum of the square differences
            between one set of values and another set of values. Specifically,
            if we can express that as some function <strong>A x = b</strong>, we
            can use it. And as it so happens, that's exactly what we're dealing
            with, so:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/d52f60b331c1b8d6733eb5217adfbc4d.svg"
            width="272px"
            height="116px"
          />
          <p>The steps taken here are:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              We have a function in a form that the normal equation can be used
              with, so
            </li>
            <li>apply the normal equation!</li>
            <li>
              Then, we want to end up with just B<sub>n</sub> on the left, so we
              start by left-multiply both sides such that we'll end up with lots
              of stuff on the left that simplified to "a factor 1", which in
              matrix maths is the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix"
                >identity matrix</a
              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              In fact, by left-multiplying with the inverse of what was already
              there, we've effectively "nullified" (but really, one-inified)
              that big, unwieldy block into the identity matrix
              <strong>I</strong>. So we substitute the mess with
              <strong>I</strong>, and then
            </li>
            <li>
              because multiplication with the identity matrix does nothing (like
              multiplying by 1 does nothing in regular algebra), we just drop
              it.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            And we're done: we now have an expression that lets us approximate
            an <code>n+1</code><sup>th</sup> order curve with a lower
            <code>n</code><sup>th</sup> order curve. It won't be an exact fit,
            but it's definitely a best approximation. So, let's implement these
            rules for raising and lowering curve order to a (semi) random curve,
            using the following graphic. Select the sketch, which has movable
            control points, and press your up and down arrow keys to raise or
            lower the curve order.

            There's a number of useful things that you can do with Bézier curves
            based on their derivative, and one of the more amusing observations
            about Bézier curves is that their derivatives are, in fact, also
            Bézier curves. In fact, the differentiation of a Bézier curve is
            relatively straightforward, although we do need a bit of math.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, let's look at the derivative rule for Bézier curves, which
            is:

            which we can also write (observing that <i>b</i> in this formula is
            the same as our <i>w</i> weights, and that <i>n</i> times a

            Or, in plain text: the derivative of an n<sup>th</sup> degree Bézier
            curve is an (n-1)<sup>th</sup> degree Bézier curve, with one fewer
            term, and new weights w'<sub>0</sub>...w'<sub>n-1</sub> derived from
            the original weights as n(w<sub>i+1</sub> - w<sub>i</sub>). So for a
            3<sup>rd</sup> degree curve, with four weights, the derivative has
            three new weights: w'<sub>0</sub> = 3(w<sub>1</sub>-w<sub>0</sub>),
            w'<sub>1</sub> = 3(w<sub>2</sub>-w<sub>1</sub>) and w'<sub>2</sub> =
            3(w<sub>3</sub>-w<sub>2</sub>).

              Sometimes just being told "this is the derivative" is nice, but
              you might want to see why this is indeed the case. As such, let's
              have a look at the proof for this derivative. First off, the
              weights are independent of the full Bézier function, so the
              derivative involves only the derivative of the polynomial basis
              function. So, let's find that:

              gives us:

              height="28px"
            />
            <p>Which is hard to work with, so let's expand that properly:</p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/bd3c740be364071c86ccf42b99d5eba4.svg"

            <p>
              Now, the trick is to turn this expression into something that has
              binomial coefficients again, so we want to end up with things that
              look like "x! over y!(x-y)!". If we can do that in a way that
              involves terms of <i>n-1</i> and <i>k-1</i>, we'll be on the right
              track.
            </p>

            />
            <p>
              And that's the first part done: the two components inside the
              parentheses are actually regular, lower-order Bézier expressions:
            </p>
            <img

              height="48px"
            />
            <p>
              Now to apply this to our weighted Bézier curves. We'll write out
              the plain curve formula that we saw earlier, and then work our way
              through to its derivative:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"

              height="112px"
            />
            <p>
              If we expand this (with some color to show how terms line up), and
              reorder the terms by increasing values for <i>k</i> we see the
              following:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/b7815b1502029ed9d805b6ba0801a53f.svg"
              width="300px"
              height="109px"
            />
            <p>
              Two of these terms fall way: the first term falls away because
              there is no -1<sup>st</sup> term in a summation. As such, it
              always contributes "nothing", so we can safely completely ignore
              it for the purpose of finding the derivative function. The other
              term is the very last term in this expansion: one involving
              <i>B<sub>n-1,n</sub></i
              >. This term would have a binomial coefficient of [<i>i</i> choose
              <i>i+1</i>], which is a non-existent binomial coefficient. Again,
              this term would contribute "nothing", so we can ignore it, too.
              This means we're left with:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"

              width="295px"
              height="71px"
            />
            <p>And that's just a summation of lower order curves:</p>
            <img

              width="716px"
              height="36px"
            />
            <p>We can rewrite this as a normal summation, and we're done:</p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"

            />
          </div>

          <p>
            Let's rewrite that in a form similar to our original formula, so we
            can see the difference. We will first list our original formula for
            Bézier curves, and then the derivative:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"

            width="533px"
            height="59px"
          />
          <p>
            What are the differences? In terms of the actual Bézier curve,
            virtually nothing! We lowered the order (rather than <i>n</i>, it's
            now <i>n-1</i>), but it's still the same Bézier function. The only
            real difference is in how the weights change when we derive the
            curve's function. If we have four points A, B, C, and D, then the
            derivative will have three points, the second derivative two, and
            the third derivative one:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/03967e3ecdbff78684995ca9c22a6106.svg"
            width="523px"
            height="73px"
          />
          <p>
            We can keep performing this trick for as long as we have more than
            one weight. Once we have one weight left, the next step will see
            <i>k = 0</i>, and the result of our "Bézier function" summation is
            zero, because we're not adding anything at all. As such, a quadratic
            curve has no second derivative, a cubic curve has no third
            derivative, and generalized: an <i>n<sup>th</sup></i> order curve
            has <i>n-1</i> (meaningful) derivatives, with any further derivative
            being zero.

            If you want to move objects along a curve, or "away from" a curve,
            the two vectors you're most interested in are the tangent vector and
            normal vector for curve points. These are actually really easy to
            find. For moving and orienting along a curve, we use the tangent,
            which indicates the direction of travel at specific points, and is
            literally just the first derivative of our curve:
          </p>

          />
          <p>
            This gives us the directional vector we want. We can normalize it to
            give us uniform directional vectors (having a length of 1.0) at each
            point, and then do whatever it is we want to do based on those
            directions:

          <p>
            The tangent is very useful for moving along a line, but what if we
            want to move away from the curve instead, perpendicular to the curve
            at some point <i>t</i>? In that case we want the
            <em>normal</em> vector. This vector runs at a right angle to the
            direction of the curve, and is typically of length 1.0, so all we
            have to do is rotate the normalized directional vector and we're
            done:

              Rotating coordinates is actually very easy, if you know the rule
              for it. You might find it explained as "applying a
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix"
                >rotation matrix</a
              >, which is what we'll look at here, too. Essentially, the idea is
              to take the circles over which we can rotate, and simply "sliding
              the coordinates" over these circles by the desired angle. If we
              want a quarter circle turn, we take the coordinate, slide it along
              the cirle by a quarter turn, and done.

              To turn any point <i>(x,y)</i> into a rotated point
              <i>(x',y')</i> (over 0,0) by some angle φ, we apply this nice and
              easy computation:

              And that's all we need to rotate any coordinate. Note that for
              quarter, half, and three-quarter turns these functions become even
              easier, since <em>sin</em> and <em>cos</em> for these angles are,
              respectively: 0 and 1, -1 and 0, and 0 and -1.

              (technically, Thomas Herter and Klaus Lott) tells us that a
              rotation matrix can be treated as a sequence of three (elementary)
              shear operations. When we combine this into a single matrix
              operation (because all matrix multiplications can be collapsed),
              we get the matrix that you see above.

          <h1><a href="#pointvectors3d">Working with 3D normals</a></h1>
          <p>
            Before we move on to the next section we need to spend a little bit
            of time on the difference between 2D and 3D. While for many things
            this difference is irrelevant and the procedures are identical (for
            instance, getting the 3D tangent is just doing what we do for 2D,
            but for x, y, and z, instead of just for x and y), when it comes to
            normals things are a little more complex, and thus more work. Mind
            you, it's not "super hard", but there are more steps involved and we
            should have a look at those.
          </p>
          <p>
            Getting normals in 3D is in principle the same as in 2D: we take the
            normalised tangent vector, and then rotate it by a quarter turn.
            However, this is where things get that little more complex: we can
            turn in quite a few directions, since "the normal" in 3D is a plane,
            not a single vector, so we basically need to define what "the"
            normal is in the 3D case.
          </p>
          <p>
            The "naïve" approach is to construct what is known as the
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenet%E2%80%93Serret_formulas"
              >Frenet normal</a
            >, where we follow a simple recipe that works in many cases (but
            does super bizarre things in some others). The idea is that even
            though there are infinitely many vectors that are perpendicular to
            the tangent (i.e. make a 90 degree angle with it), the tangent
            itself sort of lies on its own plane already: since each point on
            the curve (no matter how closely spaced) has its own tangent vector,
            we can say that each point lies in the same plane as the local
            tangent, as well as the tangents "right next to it".
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if that difference in tangent vectors is minute, "any
            difference" is all we need to find out what that plane is - or
            rather, what the vector perpendicular to that plane is. Which is
            what we need: if we can calculate that vector, and we have the
            tangent vector that we know lies on a plane, then we can rotate the
            tangent vector over the perpendicular, and presto. We have computed
            the normal using the same logic we used for the 2D case: "just
            rotate it 90 degrees".
          </p>
          <p>
            So let's do that! And in a twist surprise, we can do this in four
            lines:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>a</strong> = normalize(B'(t))</li>
            <li><strong>b</strong> = normalize(<strong>a</strong> + B''(t))</li>
            <li>
              <strong>r</strong> = normalize(<strong>b</strong> ×
              <strong>a</strong>)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>normal</strong> = normalize(<strong>r</strong> ×
              <strong>a</strong>)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Let's unpack that a little:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We start by taking the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector"
                >normalized vector</a
              >
              for the derivative at some point on the curve. We normalize it so
              the maths is less work. Less work is good.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then, we compute <strong>b</strong> which represents what a next
              point's tangent would be if the curve stopped changing at our
              point and just had the same derivative and second derivative from
              that point on.
            </li>
            <li>
              This lets us find two vectors (the derivative, and the second
              derivative added to the derivative) that lie on the same plane,
              which means we can use them to compute a vector perpendicular to
              that plane, using an elementary vector operation called the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product"
                >cross product</a
              >. (Note that while that operation uses the × operator, it's most
              definitely not a multiplication!) The result of that gives us a
              vector that we can use as the "axis of rotation" for turning the
              tangent a quarter circle to get our normal, just like we did in
              the 2D case.
            </li>
            <li>
              Since the cross product lets us find a vector that is
              perpendicular to some plane defined by two other vectors, and
              since the normal vector should be perpendicular to the plane that
              the tangent and the axis of rotation lie in, we can use the cross
              product a second time, and immediately get our normal vector.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            And then we're done, we found "the" normal vector for a 3D curve.
            Let's see what that looks like for a sample curve, shall we? You can
            move your cursor across the graphic from left to right, to show the
            normal at a point with a t value that is based on your cursor
            position: all the way on the left is 0, all the way on the right =
            1, midway is t=0.5, etc:

          <p>
            However, if you've played with that graphic a bit, you might have
            noticed something odd. The normal seems to "suddenly twist around"
            around between t=0.5 and t=0.9... Why is doing that?
          </p>
          <p>
            As it turns out, it's doing that because that's how the maths works,
            and that's the problem with Frenet normals: while they are
            "mathematically correct", they are "practically problematic", and so
            for any kind of graphics work what we really want is a way to
            compute normals that just... look good.
          </p>
          <p>Thankfully, Frenet normals are not our only option.</p>
          <p>
            Another option is to take a slightly more algorithmic approach and
            compute a form of
            <a
              href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Computation-of-rotation-minimizing-frames.pdf"
              >Rotation Minimising Frame</a
            >
            (also known as "parallel transport frame" or "Bishop frame")
            instead, where a "frame" is a set made up of the tangent, the
            rotational axis, and the normal vector, centered on an on-curve
            point.
          </p>
          <p>
            These type of frames are computed based on "the previous frame", so
            we cannot simply compute these "on demand" for single points, as we
            could for Frenet frames; we have to compute them for the entire
            curve. Thankfully, the procedure is pretty simple, and can be
            performed at the same time that you're building lookup tables for
            your curve.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea is to take a starting "tangent/rotation axis/normal" frame
            at t=0, and then compute what the next frame "should" look like by
            applying some rules that yield a good looking next frame. In the
            case of the RMF paper linked above, those rules are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Take a point on the curve for which we know the RM frame already,
            </li>
            <li>
              take a next point on the curve for which we don't know the RM
              frame yet, and
            </li>
            <li>
              reflect the known frame onto the next point, by treating the plane
              through the curve at the point exactly between the next and
              previous points as a "mirror".
            </li>
            <li>
              This gives the next point a tangent vector that's essentially
              pointing in the opposite direction of what it should be, and a
              normal that's slightly off-kilter, so:
            </li>
            <li>
              reflect the vectors of our "mirrored frame" a second time, but
              this time using the plane through the "next point" itself as
              "mirror".
            </li>
            <li>
              Done: the tangent and normal have been fixed, and we have a good
              looking frame to work with.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>So, let's write some code for that!</p>
          <div class="howtocode">
            <h3>Implementing Rotation Minimising Frames</h3>
            <p>
              We first assume we have a function for calculating the Frenet
              frame at a point, which we already discussed above, inn a way that
              it yields a frame with properties:
            </p>
            <pre><code>{
  o: origin of all vectors, i.e. the on-curve point,
  t: tangent vector,
  r: rotational axis vector,
  n: normal vector
}</code></pre>
            <p>
              Then, we can write a function that generates a sequence of RM
              frames in the following manner:
            </p>
            <pre><code>generateRMFrames(steps) -&gt; frames:
  step = 1.0/steps

  // Start off with the standard tangent/axis/normal frame
  // associated with the curve at t=0:
  frames.add(getFrenetFrame(0))

  // start constructing RM frames:
  for t0 = 0, t0 &lt; 1.0, t0 += step:
    // start with the previous, known frame
    x0 = frames.last

    // get the next frame: we're going to keep its position and tangent,
    // but we're going to recompute the axis and normal.
    t1 = t0 + step
    x1 = { o: getPoint(t1), t: getDerivative(t) }

    // First we reflect x0's tangent and axis of rotation onto x1,
    // through/ the plane of reflection at the point between x0 x1
    v1 = x1.o - x0.o
    c1 = v1 · v1
    riL = x0.r - v1 * 2/c1 * v1 · x0.r
    tiL = x0.t - v1 * 2/c1 * v1 · x0.t

    // note that v1 is a vector, but 2/c1 and (v1 · ...) are just
    // plain numbers, so we're just scaling v1 by some constant.

    // Then we reflect a second time, over a plane at x1, so that
    // the frame tangent is aligned with the curve tangent again:
    v2 = x1.t - tiL
    c2 = v2 · v2

    // and we're done here:
    x1.r = riL - v2 * 2/c2 * v2 · riL
    x1.n = x1.r × x1.t
    frames.add(x1)</code></pre>
            <p>
              Ignoring comments, this is certainly more code than when we were
              just computing a single Frenet frame, but it's not a crazy amount
              more code to get much better looking normals.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Speaking of better looking, what does this actually look like? Let's
            revisit that earlier curve, but this time use rotation minimising
            frames rather than Frenet frames:

          <p>That looks much better!</p>
          <p>
            For those reading along with the code: we don't even strictly
            speaking need a Frenet frame to start with: we could, for instance,
            treat the z-axis as our initial axis of rotation, so that our
            initial normal is <strong>(0,0,1) × tangent</strong>, and then take
            things from there, but having that initial "mathematically correct"
            frame so that the initial normal seems to line up based on the
            curve's orientation in 3D space is just nice.

          <p>
            One of the first things people run into when they start using Bézier
            curves in their own programs is "I know how to draw the curve, but
            how do I determine the bounding box?". It's actually reasonably
            straightforward to do so, but it requires having some knowledge on
            exploiting math to get the values we need. For bounding boxes, we
            aren't actually interested in the curve itself, but only in its
            "extremities": the minimum and maximum values the curve has for its
            x- and y-axis values. If you remember your calculus (provided you
            ever took calculus, otherwise it's going to be hard to remember) we
            can determine function extremities using the first derivative of
            that function, but this poses a problem, since our function is
            parametric: every axis has its own function.
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution: compute the derivative for each axis separately, and
            then fit them back together in the same way we do for the original.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's look at how a parametric Bézier curve "splits up" into two
            normal functions, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis. Note
            the leftmost figure is again an interactive curve, without labeled
            axes (you get coordinates in the graph instead). The center and
            rightmost figures are the component functions for computing the
            x-axis value, given a value for <i>t</i> (between 0 and 1
            inclusive), and the y-axis value, respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you move points in a curve sideways, you should only see the
            middle graph change; likewise, moving points vertically should only
            show a change in the right graph.

          <h1><a href="#extremities">Finding extremities: root finding</a></h1>
          <p>
            Now that we understand (well, superficially anyway) the component
            functions, we can find the extremities of our Bézier curve by
            finding maxima and minima on the component functions, by solving the
            equations B'(t) = 0 and B''(t) = 0. That said, in the case of
            quadratic curves there is no B''(t), so we only need to compute
            B'(t) = 0. So, how do we compute the first and second derivatives?
            Fairly easily, actually, until our derivatives are 4th order or
            higher... then things get really hard. But let's start simple:
          </p>
          <h3>Quadratic curves: linear derivatives.</h3>
          <p>
            Finding the solution for "where is this line 0" should be trivial:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/ec28870926b6ed08625d942b578e6fbe.svg"
            width="132px"
            height="104px"
          />
          <p>
            Done. And quadratic curves have no meaningful second derivative, so
            we're <em>really</em> done.
          </p>
          <h3>Cubic curves: the quadratic formula.</h3>
          <p>
            The derivative of a cubic curve is a quadratic curve, and finding
            the roots for a quadratic Bézier curve means we can apply the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula"
              >Quadratic formula</a
            >. If you've seen it before, you'll remember it, and if you haven't,
            it looks like this:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/0ec5cc72a428d75defb480530b50d720.svg"
            width="411px"
            height="40px"
          />
          <p>
            So, if we can express a Bézier component function as a plain
            polynomial, we're done: we just plug in the values into the
            quadratic formula, check if that square root is negative or not (if
            it is, there are no roots) and then just compute the two values that
            come out (because of that plus/minus sign we get two). Any value
            between 0 and 1 is a root that matters for Bézier curves, anything
            below or above that is irrelevant (because Bézier curves are only
            defined over the interval [0,1]). So, how do we convert?
          </p>
          <p>
            First we turn our cubic Bézier function into a quadratic one, by
            following the rule mentioned at the end of the
            <a href="#derivatives">derivatives section</a>:

          <p>
            And then, using these <em>v</em> values, we can find out what our
            <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> should be:

            height="119px"
          />
          <p>
            This gives us thee coefficients <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and
            <em>c</em> that are expressed in terms of <em>v</em> values, where
            the <em>v</em> values are just convenient expressions of our
            original <em>p</em> values, so we can do some trivial substitution
            to get:

          <img

          />
          <p>
            Easy-peasy. We can now almost trivially find the roots by plugging
            those values into the quadratic formula. We also note that the
            second derivative of a cubic curve means computing the first
            derivative of a quadratic curve, and we just saw how to do that in
            the section above.

          <h3>Quartic curves: Cardano's algorithm.</h3>
          <p>
            Quartic—fourth degree—curves have a cubic function as derivative.
            Now, cubic functions are a bit of a problem because they're really
            hard to solve. But, way back in the 16<sup>th</sup> century,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerolamo_Cardano"
              >Gerolamo Cardano</a
            >
            figured out that even if the general cubic function is really hard
            to solve, it can be rewritten to a form for which finding the roots
            is "easy", and then the only hard part is figuring out how to go
            from that form to the generic form. So:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/997a8cc704c0ab0e364cb8b532df90b0.svg"
            width="253px"
            height="44px"
          />
          <p>
            This is easier because for the "easier formula" we can use
            <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=t%5E3+%2B+pt+%2B+q"
              >regular calculus</a
            >
            to find the roots. (As a cubic function, however, it can have up to
            three roots, but two of those can be complex. For the purpose of
            Bézier curve extremities, we can completely ignore those complex
            roots, since our <em>t</em> is a plain real number from 0 to 1.)
          </p>
          <p>
            So, the trick is to figure out how to turn the first formula into
            the second formula, and to then work out the maths that gives us the
            roots. This is explained in detail over at
            <a
              href="https://trans4mind.com/personal_development/mathematics/polynomials/cubicAlgebra.htm"
              >Ken J. Ward's page</a
            >
            for solving the cubic equation, so instead of showing the maths, I'm
            simply going to show the programming code for solving the cubic
            equation, with the complex roots getting totally ignored.

            <h3>Implementing Cardano's algorithm for finding all real roots</h3>
            <p>
              The "real roots" part is fairly important, because while you
              cannot take a square, cube, etc. root of a negative number in the
              "real" number space (denoted with ℝ), this is perfectly fine in
              the

              space (denoted with ℂ). And, as it so happens, Cardano is also
              attributed as the first mathematician in history to have made use
              of complex numbers in his calculations. For this very algorithm!

            And that's it. The maths is complicated, but the code is pretty much
            just "follow the maths, while caching as many values as we can to
            reduce recomputing things as much as possible" and now we have a way
            to find all roots for a cubic function and can just move on with
            using that to find extremities of our curves.

          <h3>Quintic and higher order curves: finding numerical solutions</h3>
          <p>
            The problem with this is that as the order of the curve goes up, we
            can't actually solve those equations the normal way. We can't take
            the function, and then work out what the solutions are. Not to
            mention that even solving a third order derivative (for a fourth
            order curve) is already a royal pain in the backside. We need a
            better solution. We need numerical approaches.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's a fancy word for saying "rather than solve the function,
            treat the problem as a sequence of identical operations, the
            performing of which gets us closer and closer to the real answer".
            As it turns out, there is a really nice numerical root-finding
            algorithm, called the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Raphson"
              >Newton-Raphson</a
            >
            root finding method (yes, after
            <em
              ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton">that</a></em
            >
            Newton), which we can make use of.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Newton-Raphson approach consists of picking a value
            <em>t</em> (any value will do), and getting the corresponding value
            of the function at that <em>t</em> value. For normal functions, we
            can treat that value as a height. If the height is zero, we're done,
            we have found a root. If it's not, we take the tangent of the curve
            at that point, and extend it until it passes the x-axis, which will
            be at some new point <em>t</em>. We then repeat the procedure with
            this new value, and we keep doing this until we find our root.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mathematically, this means that for some <em>t</em>, at step
            <em>n=1</em>, we perform the following calculation until
            <em>f<sub>y</sub></em
            >(<em>t</em>) is zero, so that the next <em>t</em> is the same as
            the one we already have:

          />
          <p>
            (The Wikipedia article has a decent animation for this process, so
            I'm not adding a sketch for that here unless there are requests for
            it)
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, this works well only if we can pick good starting points, and
            our curve is continuously differentiable and doesn't have
            oscillations. Glossing over the exact meaning of those terms, the
            curves we're dealing with conform to those constraints, so as long
            as we pick good starting points, this will work. So the question is:
            which starting points do we pick?
          </p>
          <p>
            As it turns out, Newton-Raphson is so blindingly fast, so we could
            get away with just not picking: we simply run the algorithm from
            <em>t=0</em> to <em>t=1</em> at small steps (say,
            1/200<sup>th</sup>) and the result will be all the roots we want. Of
            course, this may pose problems for high order Bézier curves: 200
            steps for a 200<sup>th</sup> order Bézier curve is going to go
            wrong, but that's okay: there is no reason, ever, to use Bézier
            curves of crazy high orders. You might use a fifth order curve to
            get the "nicest still remotely workable" approximation of a full
            circle with a single Bézier curve, that's pretty much as high as
            you'll ever need to go.
          </p>
          <h3>In conclusion:</h3>
          <p>
            So now that we know how to do root finding, we can determine the
            first and second derivative roots for our Bézier curves, and show
            those roots overlaid on the previous graphics:

              Discard any <em>t</em> value that's lower than 0 or higher than 1,

          <p>
            We can construct even nicer boxes by aligning them along our curve,
            rather than along the x- and y-axis, but in order to do so we first
            need to look at how aligning works.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="aligning">
          <h1><a href="#aligning">Aligning curves</a></h1>
          <p>
            While there are an incredible number of curves we can define by
            varying the x- and y-coordinates for the control points, not all
            curves are actually distinct. For instance, if we define a curve,
            and then rotate it 90 degrees, it's still the same curve, and we'll
            find its extremities in the same spots, just at different draw
            coordinates. As such, one way to make sure we're working with a
            "unique" curve is to "axis-align" it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aligning also simplifies a curve's functions. We can translate
            (move) the curve so that the first point lies on (0,0), which turns
            our <em>n</em> term polynomial functions into <em>n-1</em> term
            functions. The order stays the same, but we have less terms. Then,
            we can rotate the curves so that the last point always lies on the
            x-axis, too, making its coordinate (...,0). This further simplifies
            the function for the y-component to an <em>n-2</em> term function.
            For instance, if we have a cubic curve such as this:
          </p>
          <img

            height="40px"
          />
          <p>
            Then translating it so that the first coordinate lies on (0,0),
            moving all <em>x</em> coordinates by -120, and all
            <em>y</em> coordinates by -160, gives us:

            height="40px"
          />
          <p>
            If we then rotate the curve so that its end point lies on the
            x-axis, the coordinates (integer-rounded for illustrative purposes
            here) become:

            height="40px"
          />
          <p>If we drop all the zero-terms, this gives us:</p>

            We can see that our original curve definition has been simplified
            considerably. The following graphics illustrate the result of
            aligning our example curves to the x-axis, with the cubic case using
            the coordinates that were just used in the example formulae:

            With our knowledge of bounding boxes, and curve alignment, We can
            now form the "tight" bounding box for curves. We first align our
            curve, recording the translation we performed, "T", and the rotation
            angle we used, "R". We then determine the aligned curve's normal
            bounding box. Once we have that, we can map that bounding box back
            to our original curve by rotating it by -R, and then translating it
            by -T. We now have nice tight bounding boxes for our curves:

          <p>
            These are, strictly speaking, not necessarily the tightest possible
            bounding boxes. It is possible to compute the optimal bounding box
            by determining which spanning lines we need to effect a minimal box
            area, but because of the parametric nature of Bézier curves this is
            actually a rather costly operation, and the gain in bounding
            precision is often not worth it. If there is high demand for it,
            I'll add a section on how to precisely compute the best fit bounding
            box, but the maths is fairly grueling and just not really worth
            spending time on.

          <p>
            Now that we know how to align a curve, there's one more thing we can
            calculate: inflection points. Imagine we have a variable size circle
            that we can slide up against our curve. We place it against the
            curve and adjust its radius so that where it touches the curve, the
            curvatures of the curve and the circle are the same, and then we
            start to slide the circle along the curve - for quadratic curves, we
            can always do this without the circle behaving oddly: we might have
            to change the radius of the circle as we slide it along, but it'll
            always sit against the same side of the curve.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what happens with cubic curves? Imagine we have an S curve and
            we place our circle at the start of the curve, and start sliding it
            along. For a while we can simply adjust the radius and things will
            be fine, but once we get to the midpoint of that S, something odd
            happens: the circle "flips" from one side of the curve to the other
            side, in order for the curvatures to keep matching. This is called
            an inflection, and we can find out where those happen relatively
            easily.
          </p>
          <p>What we need to do is solve a simple equation:</p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/bafdb6583323bda71d9a15c02d1fdec2.svg"
            width="59px"
            height="16px"
          />
          <p>
            What we're saying here is that given the curvature function
            <em>C(t)</em>, we want to know for which values of <em>t</em> this
            function is zero, meaning there is no "curvature", which will be
            exactly at the point between our circle being on one side of the
            curve, and our circle being on the other side of the curve. So what
            does <em>C(t)</em> look like? Actually something that seems not too
            hard:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/2029bca9f4fa15739553636af99b70a8.svg"
            width="385px"
            height="21px"
          />
          <p>
            The function <em>C(t)</em> is the cross product between the first
            and second derivative functions for the parametric dimensions of our
            curve. And, as already shown, derivatives of Bézier curves are just
            simpler Bézier curves, with very easy to compute new coefficients,
            so this should be pretty easy.
          </p>
          <p>
            However as we've seen in the section on aligning, aligning lets us
            simplify things <em>a lot</em>, by completely removing the
            contributions of the first coordinate from most mathematical
            evaluations, and removing the last <em>y</em> coordinate as well by
            virtue of the last point lying on the x-axis. So, while we can
            evaluate <em>C(t) = 0</em> for our curve, it'll be much easier to
            first axis-align the curve and <em>then</em> evaluating the
            curvature function.

            <h3>Let's derive the full formula anyway</h3>
            <p>
              Of course, before we do our aligned check, let's see what happens
              if we compute the curvature function without axis-aligning. We
              start with the first and second derivatives, given our basis
              functions:

              height="71px"
            />
            <p>And of course the same functions for <em>y</em>:</p>

            />
            <p>
              Asking a computer to now compose the <em>C(t)</em> function for us
              (and to expand it to a readable form of simple terms) gives us
              this rather overly complicated set of arithmetic expressions:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"

              width="552px"
              height="97px"
            />
            <p>
              That is... unwieldy. So, we note that there are a lot of terms
              that involve multiplications involving x1, y1, and y4, which would
              all disappear if we axis-align our curve, which is why aligning is
              a great idea.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Aligning our curve so that three of the eight coefficients become
            zero, we end up with the following simple term function for
            <em>C(t)</em>:

            height="21px"
          />
          <p>
            That's a lot easier to work with: we see a fair number of terms that
            we can compute and then cache, giving us the following
            simplification:

          <p>
            This is a plain quadratic curve, and we know how to solve
            <em>C(t) = 0</em>; we use the quadratic formula:

          <p>
            We can easily compute this value <em>if</em> the discriminator isn't
            a negative number (because we only want real roots, not complex
            roots), and <em>if</em> <em>x</em> is not zero, because divisions by
            zero are rather useless.
          </p>
          <p>
            Taking that into account, we compute <em>t</em>, we disregard any
            <em>t</em> value that isn't in the Bézier interval [0,1], and we now
            know at which <em>t</em> value(s) our curve will inflect.

          <p>
            While quadratic curves are relatively simple curves to analyze, the
            same cannot be said of the cubic curve. As a curvature is controlled
            by more than one control point, it exhibits all kinds of features
            like loops, cusps, odd colinear features, and as many as two
            inflection points because the curvature can change direction up to
            three times. Now, knowing what kind of curve we're dealing with
            means that some algorithms can be run more efficiently than if we
            have to implement them as generic solvers, so is there a way to
            determine the curve type without lots of work?
          </p>
          <p>
            As it so happens, the answer is yes, and the solution we're going to
            look at was presented by Maureen C. Stone from Xerox PARC and Tony
            D. deRose from the University of Washington in their joint paper
            <a
              href="http://graphics.pixar.com/people/derose/publications/CubicClassification/paper.pdf"
              >"A Geometric Characterization of Parametric Cubic curves"</a
            >. It was published in 1989, and defines curves as having a
            "canonical" form (i.e. a form that all curves can be reduced to)
            from which we can immediately tell what features a curve will have.
            So how does it work?
          </p>
          <p>
            The first observation that makes things work is that if we have a
            cubic curve with four points, we can apply a linear transformation
            to these points such that three of the points end up on (0,0), (0,1)
            and (1,1), with the last point then being "somewhere". After
            applying that transformation, the location of that last point can
            then tell us what kind of curve we're dealing with. Specifically, we
            see the following breakdown:
          </p>

          />

          <p>
            This is a fairly funky image, so let's see how it breaks down. We
            see the three fixed points at (0,0), (0,1) and (1,1), and then the
            fourth point is somewhere. Depending on where it is, our curve will
            have certain features. Namely, if the fourth point is...
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                anywhere on and in the red zone, the curve will either be
                self-intersecting (yielding a loop), or it will have a sharp
                discontinuity (yielding a cusp). Anywhere inside the red zone,
                this will be a loop. We won't know <em>where</em> that loop is
                (in terms of <em>t</em> values), but we are guaranteed that
                there is one.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                on the left (red) edge, the curve will have a cusp. We again
                don't know <em>where</em>, just that it has one. This edge is
                described by the function:

                on the lower right (pink) edge, the curve will have a loop at

                <em>on</em> the curve. This edge is described by the function:

                on the top (blue) edge, the curve will have a loop at t=0, so we
                know the start coordinate of the curve also lies <em>on</em> the
                curve. This edge is described by the function:

            <li>
              <p>
                inside the green zone, the curve will have a single inflection,
                switching concave/convex once.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                between the red and green zones, the curve has two inflections,
                meaning its curvature switches between concave/convex form
                twice.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                anywhere on the right of the red zone, the curve will have no
                inflections. It'll just be a well-behaved arch.
              </p>

            Of course, this map is fairly small, but the regions extend to
            infinity, with well defined boundaries.

              the loop-boundaries come from rewriting the curve into canonical
              form, and then solving the formulae for which constraints must
              hold for which possible curve properties. In the paper these
              functions yield formulae for where you will find cusp points, or
              loops where we know t=0 or t=1, but those functions are derived
              for the full cubic expression, meaning they apply to t=-∞ to
              t=∞... For Bézier curves we only care about the "clipped interval"
              t=0 to t=1, so some of the properties that apply when you look at
              the curve over an infinite interval simply don't apply to the
              Bézier curve interval.
            </p>
            <p>
              The right bound for the loop region, indicating where the curve
              switches from "having inflections" to "having a loop", for the
              general cubic curve, is actually mirrored over x=1, but for Bézier
              curves this right half doesn't apply, so we don't need to pay
              attention to it. Similarly, the boundaries for t=0 and t=1 loops
              are also nice clean curves but get "cut off" when we only look at
              what the general curve does over the interval t=0 to t=1.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the full details, head over to the paper and read through
              sections 3 and 4. If you still remember your high school
              precalculus, you can probably follow along with this paper,
              although you might have to read it a few times before all the bits
              "click".
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            So now the question becomes: how do we manipulate our curve so that
            it fits this canonical form, with three fixed points, and one "free"
            point? Enter linear algebra. Don't worry, I'll be doing all the math
            for you, as well as show you what the effect is on our curves, but
            basically we're going to be using linear algebra, rather than
            calculus, because "it's way easier". Sometimes a calculus approach
            is very hard to work with, when the equivalent geometrical solution
            is super obvious.
          </p>
          <p>
            The approach is going to start with a curve that doesn't have
            all-colinear points (so we need to make sure the points don't all
            fall on a straight line), and then applying four graphics operations
            that you will probably have heard of: translation (moving all points
            by some fixed x- and y-distance), scaling (multiplying all points by
            some x and y scale factor), and shearing (an operation that turns
            rectangles into parallelograms).
          </p>
          <p>
            Step 1: we translate any curve by -p1.x and -p1.y, so that the curve
            starts at (0,0). We're going to make use of an interesting trick
            here, by pretending our 2D coordinates are 3D, with the
            <em>z</em> coordinate simply always being 1. This is an old trick in
            graphics to overcome the limitations of 2D transformations: without
            it, we can only turn (x,y) coordinates into new coordinates of the
            form (ax + by, cx + dy), which means we can't do translation, since
            that requires we end up with some kind of (x + a, y + b). If we add
            a bogus <em>z</em> coordinate that is always 1, then we can suddenly
            add arbitrary values. For example:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/d089cc0687982a3302249bb82af3fc16.svg"
            width="472px"
            height="55px"
          />
          <p>
            Sweet! <em>z</em> stays 1, so we can effectively ignore it entirely,
            but we added some plain values to our x and y coordinates. So, if we
            want to subtract p1.x and p1.y, we use:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/058fa85ac31eb666857a860fdedd79df.svg"
            width="455px"
            height="57px"
          />
          <p>
            Running all our coordinates through this transformation gives a new
            set of coordinates, let's call those <strong>U</strong>, where the
            first coordinate lies on (0,0), and the rest is still somewhat free.
            Our next job is to make sure point 2 ends up lying on the
            <em>x=0</em> line, so what we want is a transformation matrix that,
            when we run it, subtracts <em>x</em> from whatever <em>x</em> we
            currently have. This is called
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_matrix">shearing</a>,
            and the typical x-shear matrix and its transformation looks like
            this:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/10025fdab2b3fd20f5d389cbe7e3e3ce.svg"
            width="195px"
            height="53px"
          />
          <p>
            So we want some shearing value that, when multiplied by <em>y</em>,
            yields <em>-x</em>, so our x coordinate becomes zero. That value is
            simply <em>-x/y</em>, because *-x/y * y = -x*. Done:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/20684d22b3ddc52fd6abde8ce56608a9.svg"
            width="133px"
            height="67px"
          />
          <p>
            Now, running this on all our points generates a new set of
            coordinates, let's call those <strong>V</strong>, which now have
            point 1 on (0,0) and point 2 on (0, some-value), and we wanted it at
            (0,1), so we need to
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_%28geometry%29"
              >do some scaling</a
            >
            to make sure it ends up at (0,1). Additionally, we want point 3 to
            end up on (1,1), so we can also scale x to make sure its
            x-coordinate will be 1 after we run the transform. That means we'll
            be x-scaling by 1/point3<sub>x</sub>, and y-scaling by
            point2<sub>y</sub>. This is really easy:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/8cbef24b8c3b26f9daf2f89d27d36e95.svg"
            width="137px"
            height="71px"
          />
          <p>
            Then, finally, this generates a new set of coordinates, let's call
            those W, of which point 1 lies on (0,0), point 2 lies on (0,1), and
            point three lies on (1, ...) so all that's left is to make sure
            point 3 ends up at (1,1) - but we can't scale! Point 2 is already in
            the right place, and y-scaling would move it out of (0,1) again, so
            our only option is to y-shear point three, just like how we
            x-sheared point 2 earlier. In this case, we do the same trick, but
            with <code>y/x</code> rather than <code>x/y</code> because we're not
            x-shearing but y-shearing. Additionally, we don't actually want to
            end up at zero (which is what we did before) so we need to shear
            towards an offset, in this case 1:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/0430e8c7f7d4ec80e6527f96f3d56e5c.svg"
            width="140px"
            height="65px"
          />
          <p>
            And this generates our final set of four coordinates. Of these, we
            already know that points 1 through 3 are (0,0), (0,1) and (1,1), and
            only the last coordinate is "free". In fact, given any four starting
            coordinates, the resulting "transformation mapped" coordinate will
            be:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/2f85d84f0e3dd14cc25e48583aed3822.svg"
            width="455px"
            height="91px"
          />
          <p>
            That looks very complex, but notice that every coordinate value is
            being offset by the initial translation, and a lot of terms in there
            repeat: it's pretty easy to calculate this fast, since there's so
            much we can cache and reuse while we compute this mapped coordinate!
          </p>
          <p>
            First, let's just do that translation step as a "preprocessing"
            operation so we don't have to subtract the values all the time. What
            does that leave?
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/83262761bb7fa9b832fe483ded436973.svg"
            width="353px"
            height="59px"
          />
          <p>
            Suddenly things look a lot simpler: the mapped x is fairly straight
            forward to compute, and we see that the mapped y actually contains
            the mapped x in its entirety, so we'll have that part already
            available when we need to evaluate it. In fact, let's pull out all
            those common factors to see just how simple this is:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/f3261ad2802d980ebe6e35b272375700.svg"
            width="408px"
            height="40px"
          />
          <p>
            That's kind of super-simple to write out in code, I think you'll
            agree. Coding math tends to be easier than the formulae initially
            make it look!

              Doing maths can be a pain, so whenever possible, I like to make
              computers do the work for me. Especially for things like this, I
              simply use
              <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica">Mathematica</a>.
              Tracking all this math by hand is insane, and we invented
              computers, literally, to do this for us. I have no reason to use
              pen and paper when I can write out what I want to do in a program,
              and have the program do the math for me. And real math, too, with
              symbols, not with numbers. In fact,

              Now, I know, you're thinking "but Mathematica is super expensive!"
              and that's true, it's

            So, let's write up a sketch that'll show us the canonical form for
            any curve drawn in blue, overlaid on our canonical map, so that we
            can immediately tell which features our curve must have, based on
            where the fourth coordinate is located on the map:

          <p>
            One common task that pops up in things like CSS work, or parametric
            equalisers, or image leveling, or any other number of applications
            where Bezier curves are used as control curves in a way that there
            is really only ever one "y" value associated with one "x" value, you
            might want to cut out the middle man, as it were, and compute "y"
            directly based on "x". After all, the function looks simple enough,
            finding the "y" value should be simple too, right? Unfortunately,
            not really. However, it <em>is</em> possible and as long as you have
            some code in place to help, it's not a lot of a work either.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll be tackling this problem in two stages: the first, which is
            the hard part, is figuring out which "t" value belongs to any given
            "x" value. For instance, have a look at the following graphic. On
            the left we have a Bezier curve that looks for all intents and
            purposes like it fits our criteria: every "x" has one and only one
            associated "y" value. On the right we see the function for just the
            "x" values: that's a cubic curve, but not a really crazy cubic
            curve. If you mouse over the graphic, you will see a red line drawn
            that corresponds to the <code>x</code> coordinate under your cursor:
            vertical in the left graphic, horizontal in the right.
          </p>
          <Graphic
            title="Finding t, given x=x(t). Left: our curve, right: the x=x(t) function"
            setup="{this.tforx.setup}"
            draw="{this.tforx.draw}"
            onMouseMove="{this.onMouseMove}"
          />

          <p>
            Now, if you look more closely at that right graphic, you'll notice
            something interesting: if we treat the red line as "the x axis",
            then the point where the function crosses our line is really just a
            root for the cubic function x(t). So... can we just use root finding
            to get the "t" value associated with an "x" value? To which the
            answer should unsurprisingly be " yes, we can". Sure, we'll need to
            compute cubic roots, but we've already seen how to do that in the
            section on <a href="#extremities">finding extremities</a>, and we're
            not dealing with a complicated case: we <em>know</em> there is only
            root, so let's go and find it!
          </p>
          <p>First, let's look at the function for x(t):</p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"

            width="335px"
            height="19px"
          />
          <p>
            We can rewrite this to a plain polynomial form, by just fully
            writing out the expansion and then collecting the polynomial
            factors, as:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"

            width="445px"
            height="19px"
          />
          <p>
            Nothing special here: that's a standard cubic polynomial in "power"
            form (i.e. all the terms are ordered by their power of
            <code>t</code>). So, given that <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>,
            <code>c</code>, <code>d</code>, <em>and</em> <code>x(t)</code> are
            all known constants, we can trivially rewrite this (by moving the
            <code>x(t)</code> across the equal sign) as:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/de3bd3e271d72194c730d0ae44f031a8.svg"
            width="465px"
            height="19px"
          />
          <p>
            You might be wondering "where did all the other 'minus x' for all
            the other values a, b, c, and d go?" and the answer there is that
            they all cancel out, so the only one we actually need to subtract is
            the one at the end. Handy! So now we just... solve this equation: we
            know everything except <code>t</code>, we just need some
            mathematical insight to tell us how to do this.
          </p>
          <p>
            ...Of course "just" is not the right qualifier here, there is
            nothing "just" about finding the roots of a cubic function, but
            thankfully we've already covered the tool to do this in the
            <a href="#extremities">root finding</a> section: Gerolano Cardano's
            solution for cubic roots. Of course, we still need to be a bit
            careful, because cubic roots are complicated things: you can get up
            to three roots back, even though we only "want" one root. In our
            case, only one will be both a real number (as opposed to a complex
            number) <em>and</em> lie in the <code>t</code> interval [0,1], so we
            need to filter for that:
          </p>
          <pre><code>double x = some value we know!
double[] roots = getTforX(x);
double t;

            How long is a Bézier curve? As it turns out, that's not actually an
            easy question, because the answer requires maths that —much like
            root finding— cannot generally be solved the traditional way. If we
            have a parametric curve with <em>f<sub>x</sub>(t)</em> and
            <em>f<sub>y</sub>(t)</em>, then the length of the curve, measured
            from start point to some point <em>t = z</em>, is computed using the
            following seemingly straight forward (if a bit overwhelming)
            formula:

            This formula says that the length of a parametric curve is in fact
            equal to the <strong>area</strong> underneath a function that looks
            a remarkable amount like Pythagoras' rule for computing the diagonal
            of a straight angled triangle. This sounds pretty simple, right?
            Sadly, it's far from simple... cutting straight to after the chase
            is over: for quadratic curves, this formula generates an

              >unwieldy computation</a
            >, and we're simply not going to implement things that way. For
            cubic Bézier curves, things get even more fun, because there is no
            "closed form" solution, meaning that due to the way calculus works,
            there is no generic formula that allows you to calculate the arc
            length. Let me just repeat this, because it's fairly crucial:

                >for cubic and higher Bézier curves, there is no way to solve

            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we turn to numerical approaches again. The method we'll look at
            here is the
            <a

              >Gauss quadrature</a
            >. This approximation is a really neat trick, because for any
            <em>n<sup>th</sup></em> degree polynomial it finds approximated
            values for an integral really efficiently. Explaining this procedure
            in length is way beyond the scope of this page, so if you're
            interested in finding out why it works, I can recommend the
            University of South Florida video lecture on the procedure, linked
            in this very paragraph. The general solution we're looking for is
            the following:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"

          <p>
            In plain text: an integral function can always be treated as the sum
            of an (infinite) number of (infinitely thin) rectangular strips
            sitting "under" the function's plotted graph. To illustrate this
            idea, the following graph shows the integral for a sinusoid
            function. The more strips we use (and of course the more we use, the
            thinner they get) the closer we get to the true area under the
            curve, and thus the better the approximation:
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <Graphic
              inline="{true}"
              static="{true}"

              draw="{this.drawSuperFineIntegral}"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            Now, infinitely many terms to sum and infinitely thin rectangles are
            not something that computers can work with, so instead we're going
            to approximate the infinite summation by using a sum of a finite
            number of "just thin" rectangular strips. As long as we use a high
            enough number of thin enough rectangular strips, this will give us
            an approximation that is pretty close to what the real value is.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, the trick is to come up with useful rectangular strips. A naive
            way is to simply create <em>n</em> strips, all with the same width,
            but there is a far better way using special values for
            <em>C</em> and <em>f(t)</em> depending on the value of <em>n</em>,
            which indicates how many strips we'll use, and it's called the
            Legendre-Gauss quadrature.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach uses strips that are <em>not</em> spaced evenly, but
            instead spaces them in a special way based on describing the
            function as a polynomial (the more strips, the more accurate the
            polynomial), and then computing the exact integral for that
            polynomial. We're essentially performing arc length computation on a
            flattened curve, but flattening it based on the intervals dictated
            by the Legendre-Gauss solution.
          </p>
          <div class="note">
            <p>
              Note that one requirement for the approach we'll use is that the
              integral must run from -1 to 1. That's no good, because we're
              dealing with Bézier curves, and the length of a section of curve
              applies to values which run from 0 to "some value smaller than or
              equal to 1" (let's call that value <em>z</em>). Thankfully, we can
              quite easily transform any integral interval to any other integral
              interval, by shifting and scaling the inputs. Doing so, we get the
              following:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/5509919419288129322cfbd4c60d0a4f.svg"
              width="341px"
              height="72px"
            />
            <p>
              That may look a bit more complicated, but the fraction involving
              <em>z</em> is a fixed number, so the summation, and the evaluation
              of the <em>f(t)</em> values are still pretty simple.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, what do we need to perform this calculation? For one, we'll
              need an explicit formula for <em>f(t)</em>, because that
              derivative notation is handy on paper, but not when we have to
              implement it. We'll also need to know what these
              <em>C<sub>i</sub></em> and <em>t<sub>i</sub></em> values should
              be. Luckily, that's less work because there are actually many
              tables available that give these values, for any <em>n</em>, so if
              we want to approximate our integral with only two terms (which is
              a bit low, really) then
              <a href="legendre-gauss.html">these tables</a> would tell us that
              for <em>n=2</em> we must use the following values:
            </p>
            <img

              width="63px"
              height="93px"
            />
            <p>
              Which means that in order for us to approximate the integral, we
              must plug these values into the approximate function, which gives
              us:
            </p>
            <img

              height="44px"
            />
            <p>
              We can program that pretty easily, provided we have that
              <em>f(t)</em> available, which we do, as we know the full
              description for the Bézier curve functions B<sub>x</sub>(t) and
              B<sub>y</sub>(t).

          <p>
            If we use the Legendre-Gauss values for our <em>C</em> values
            (thickness for each strip) and <em>t</em> values (location of each
            strip), we can determine the approximate length of a Bézier curve by
            computing the Legendre-Gauss sum. The following graphic shows a
            cubic curve, with its computed lengths; Go ahead and change the
            curve, to see how its length changes. One thing worth trying is to
            see if you can make a straight line, and see if the length matches
            what you'd expect. What if you form a line with the control points
            on the outside, and the start/end points on the inside?

            Sometimes, we don't actually need the precision of a true arc
            length, and we can get away with simply computing the approximate
            arc length instead. The by far fastest way to do this is to flatten
            the curve and then simply calculate the linear distance from point
            to point. This will come with an error, but this can be made
            arbitrarily small by increasing the segment count.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we combine the work done in the previous sections on curve
            flattening and arc length computation, we can implement these with
            minimal effort:

            Try clicking on the sketch and using your up and down arrow keys to
            lower the number of segments for both the quadratic and cubic curve.
            You may notice that the error in length is actually pretty
            significant, even if the percentage is fairly low: if the number of
            segments used yields an error of 0.1% or higher, the flattened curve
            already looks fairly obviously flattened. And of course, the longer
            the curve, the more significant the error will be.

          <h1><a href="#curvature">Curvature of a curve</a></h1>
          <p>
            Imagine we have two curves, and we want to line them in up in a way
            that "looks right". What would we use as metric to let a computer
            decide what "looks right" means? For instance, we can start by
            ensuring that the two curves share an end coordinate, so that there
            is no "gap" between leaving one curve and entering the next, but
            that won't guarantee that things look right: both curves can be
            going in wildly different directions, and the resulting joined
            geometry will have a corner in it, rather than a smooth transition
            from one curve to the next. What we want is to ensure that the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature"
              ><em>curvature</em></a
            >
            at the transition from one curve to the next "looks good". So, we
            could have them share an end coordinate, and then ensure that the
            derivatives for both curves match at that coordinate, and at a
            casual glance, that seems the perfect solution: if we make the
            derivatives match, then both the "direction" in which we travel from
            one curve to the next is the same, and the "speed" at which we
            travel the curve will be the same.
          </p>
          <p>Problem solved!</p>
          <p>
            But, if we think about this a little more, this cannot possible
            work, because of something that you may have noticed in the section
            on <a href="#reordering">reordering curves</a>: what a curve looks
            like, and the function that draws that curve, are not in some kind
            of universal, fixed, one-to-one relation. If we have some quadratic
            curve, then simply by raising the curve order we can get
            corresponding cubic, quartic, and higher and higher mathematical
            expressions that all draw the <em>exact same curve</em> but with
            wildly different derivatives. So: if we want to make a transition
            from one curve to the next look good, and we want to use the
            derivative, then we suddenly need to answer the question: "Which
            derivative?".
          </p>
          <p>
            How would you even decide? What makes the cubic derivatives better
            or less suited than, say, quintic derivatives? Wouldn't it be nicer
            if we could use something that was inherent to the curve, without
            being tied to the functions that yield that curve? And (of course)
            as it turns out, there is a way to define curvature in such a way
            that it only relies on what the curve actually looks like, and given
            where this section is in the larger body of this Primer, it should
            hopefully not be surprising that we thing we can use to define
            curvature is the thing we talked about in the previous section: arc
            length.
          </p>
          <p>
            Intuitively, this should make sense, even if we have no idea what
            the maths would look like: if we travel some fixed distance along
            some curve, then the point at that distance is simply the point at
            that distance. It doesn't matter what function we used to draw the
            curve: once we know what the curve looks like, the function(s) used
            to draw it become irrelevant: a point a third along the full
            distance of the curve is simply the point a third along the distance
            of the curve.
          </p>
          <p>
            You might think that in order to find the curvature of a curve, we
            now need to find and then solve the arc length function, and that
            would be a problem because we just saw that there is no way to
            actually do that: don't worry, we don't. We do need to know the
            <em>form</em> of the arc length function, which we saw above, but
            it's not the thing we're actually interested in, and we're going to
            be rewriting it in a way that makes most of the crazy complex things
            about it just... disappear.
          </p>

              >running through the steps necessary</a

            to determine what we're left with if we use the arclength function's

            <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/275324/71940">here</a>),
            rather than the curve's original function's derivative, then the
            integral disappears entirely (because of the

              >fundamental therem of calculus</a
            >), and we're left with some surprisingly simple maths that relates
            curvature (denoted as κ, "kappa") to—and this is the truly
            surprising bit—a specific combination of derivatives of our original
            function.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let me just highlight that before we move on: we calculate the
            curvature of a curve using the arc length function derivative,
            because the original function's derivative is entirely unreliable,
            and in doing so we end up with a formula that expresses curvature in
            terms of the original function's derivatives.
          </p>
          <p><em>That's crazy!</em></p>
          <p>
            But, that's what makes maths such an interesting thing: it can show
            you that all your assumptions are completely wrong, only to then go
            "but actually, you were on the right track all along, here: ..."
            with a solution that is so easy to work with as to almost seem
            mundane. So: enough of all this text, how do we calculate curvature?
            What is the function for κ? Concisely, the function is this:
          </p>
          <img

            height="47px"
          />
          <p>
            Which is really just a "short form" that glosses over the fact that
            we're dealing with functions:
          </p>
          <img

            width="239px"
            height="55px"
          />
          <p>
            And while that's a litte more verbose, it's still just as simple to
            work with as the first function: the curvature at some point on any
            (and this cannot be overstated: <em>any</em>) curve is a ratio
            between the first and second derivative cross product, and something
            that looks oddly similar to the standard Euclidean distance
            function. And nothing in these functions is hard to calculate
            either: for Bézier curves, simply knowing our curve coordinates
            means
            <a href="#derivatives"
              >we know what the first and second derivatives are</a
            >, and so evaluating this function for any <strong>t</strong> value
            is just a matter of basic arithematics.
          </p>

            <h3>Implement the kappa function</h3>
            <p>In fact, let's just implement it right now:</p>
            <pre><code>function kappa(t, B):
  d = B.getDerivative()
  dd = d.getDerivative()
  dx = d.getX(t)
  dy = d.getY(t)

            <p>That was easy!</p>
            <p>
              In fact, it stays easy because we can also compute the associated
              "radius of curvature", which gives us the implicit circle that
              "fits" the curve's curvature at any point, using what is possibly
              the simplest relation in this entire primer:

            So with all of that covered, let's line up some curves! The
            following graphic gives you two curves that look identical, but use
            quadratic and cubic functions, respectively. As you can see, despite
            their derivatives being necessarily different, their curvature
            (thanks to being derived based on maths that "ignores" specific
            function derivative, and instead gives a formulat that smooths out
            any differences) is exactly the same. And because of that, we can
            put them together such that the point where they overlap has the
            same curvature for both curves, giving us the smoothest looking
            transition we could ask for.

          <p>
            One thing you may have noticed in this sketch is that sometimes the
            curvature looks fine, but seems to be pointing in the wrong
            direction, making it hard to line up the curves properly. In your
            code you typically solve this by matching absolute values, but
            that's not super easy to program visually... however, we
            <em>can</em> just show the curvature on both sides of the curve,
            making lining things up a bit easier:

          <h1>
            <a href="#tracing">Tracing a curve at fixed distance intervals</a>
          </h1>
          <p>
            Say you want to draw a curve with a dashed line, rather than a solid
            line, or you want to move something along the curve at fixed
            distance intervals over time, like a train along a track, and you
            want to use Bézier curves.
          </p>
          <p>Now you have a problem.</p>
          <p>
            The reason you have a problem is that Bézier curves are parametric
            functions with non-linear behaviour, whereas moving a train along a
            track is about as close to a practical example of linear behaviour
            as you can get. The problem we're faced with is that we can't just
            pick <em>t</em> values at some fixed interval and expect the Bézier
            functions to generate points that are spaced a fixed distance apart.
            In fact, let's look at the relation between "distance long a curve"
            and "<em>t</em> value", by plotting them against one another.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following graphic shows a particularly illustrative curve, and
            it's length-to-t plot. For linear traversal, this line needs to be
            straight, running from (0,0) to (length,1). This is, it's safe to
            say, not what we'll see, we'll see something wobbly instead. To make
            matters even worse, the length-to-<em>t</em> function is also of a
            much higher order than our curve is: while the curve we're using for
            this exercise is a cubic curve, which can switch concave/convex form
            once at best, the plot shows that the distance function along the
            curve is able to switch forms three times (to see this, try creating
            an S curve with the start/end close together, but the control points
            far apart).
          </p>
          <Graphic
            title="The t-for-distance function"
            setup="{this.setup}"
            draw="{this.plotOnly}"
          />

          <p>
            We see a function that might be invertible, but we won't be able to
            do so, symbolically. You may remember from the section on arc length
            that we cannot actually compute the true arc length function as an
            expression of <em>t</em>, which means we also can't compute the true
            inverted function that gives <em>t</em> as an expression of length.
            So how do we fix this?
          </p>
          <p>
            One way is to do what the graphic does: simply run through the
            curve, determine its <em>t</em>-for-length values as a set of
            discrete values at some high resolution (the graphic uses 100
            discrete points), and then use those as a basis for finding an
            appropriate <em>t</em> value, given a distance along the curve. This
            works quite well, actually, and is fairly fast.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can use some colour to show the difference between distance-based
            and time based intervals: the following graph is similar to the
            previous one, except it segments the curve in terms of
            equal-distance intervals. This shows as regular colour intervals
            going down the graph, but the mapping to <em>t</em> values is not
            linear, so there will be (highly) irregular intervals along the
            horizontal axis. It also shows the curve in an alternating colouring
            based on the t-for-distance values we find our LUT:

            onKeyDown="{this.props.onKeyDown}"
          />

          <p>
            Use your up and down arrow keys to increase or decrease the number
            of equidistant segments used to colour the curve.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, are there better ways? One such way is discussed in "<a
              href="http://www.geometrictools.com/Documentation/MovingAlongCurveSpecifiedSpeed.pdf"
              >Moving Along a Curve with Specified Speed</a
            >" by David Eberly of Geometric Tools, LLC, but basically because we
            have no explicit length function (or rather, one we don't have to
            constantly compute for different intervals), you may simply be
            better off with a traditional lookup table (LUT).

            Let's look at some more things we will want to do with Bézier
            curves. Almost immediately after figuring out how to get bounding
            boxes to work, people tend to run into the problem that even though
            the minimal bounding box (based on rotation) is tight, it's not
            sufficient to perform true collision detection. It's a good first
            step to make sure there <em>might</em> be a collision (if there is
            no bounding box overlap, there can't be one), but in order to do
            real collision detection we need to know whether or not there's an
            intersection on the actual curve.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll do this in steps, because it's a bit of a journey to get to
            curve/curve intersection checking. First, let's start simple, by
            implementing a line-line intersection checker. While we can solve
            this the traditional calculus way (determine the functions for both
            lines, then compute the intersection by equating them and solving
            for two unknowns), linear algebra actually offers a nicer solution.
          </p>
          <h3>Line-line intersections</h3>
          <p>
            If we have two line segments with two coordinates each, segments A-B
            and C-D, we can find the intersection of the lines these segments
            are an intervals on by linear algebra, using the procedure outlined
            in this
            <a
              href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=tutorials&d2=geometry2#line_line_intersection"
              >top coder</a
            >
            article. Of course, we need to make sure that the intersection isn't
            just on the lines our line segments lie on, but actually on our line
            segments themselves. So after we find the intersection, we need to
            verify that it lies without the bounds of our original line
            segments.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following graphic implements this intersection detection,
            showing a red point for an intersection on the lines our segments
            lie on (thus being a virtual intersection point), and a green point
            for an intersection that lies on both segments (being a real
            intersection point).

              checking function. The basics are covered in the article mentioned
              above, but sometimes you need more function signatures, because
              you might not want to call your function with eight distinct
              parameters. Maybe you're using point structs for the line. Let's
              get coding:

      ny=(x1*y2-y1*x2)*(y3-y4)-(y1-y2)*(x3*y4-y3*x4),

          <h3>What about curve-line intersections?</h3>
          <p>
            Curve/line intersection is more work, but we've already seen the
            techniques we need to use in order to perform it: first we
            translate/rotate both the line and curve together, in such a way
            that the line coincides with the x-axis. This will position the
            curve in a way that makes it cross the line at points where its
            y-function is zero. By doing this, the problem of finding
            intersections between a curve and a line has now become the problem
            of performing root finding on our translated/rotated curve, as we
            already covered in the section on finding extremities.

          <p>
            Curve/curve intersection, however, is more complicated. Since we
            have no straight line to align to, we can't simply align one of the
            curves and be left with a simple procedure. Instead, we'll need to
            apply two techniques we've met before: de Casteljau's algorithm, and
            curve splitting.

            Using de Casteljau's algorithm to split the curve we can now
            implement curve/curve intersection finding using a "divide and

            <li>
              If their bounding boxes overlap, split up each curve into two
              sub-curves

            </li>
            <li>
              For each pair, check whether their bounding boxes overlap.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If their bounding boxes do not overlap, discard the pair, as
                  there is no intersection between this pair of curves.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If there <em>is</em> overlap, rerun all steps for this pair.

            </li>
            <li>
              Once the sub-curves we form are so small that they effectively
              occupy sub-pixel areas, we consider an intersection found, noting
              that we might have a cluster of multiple intersections at the
              sub-pixel level, out of which we pick one to act as "found"
              <code>t</code> value (we can either throw all but one away, we can
              average the cluster's <code>t</code> values, or you can do
              something even more creative).
            </li>

          <p>
            This algorithm will start with a single pair, "balloon" until it
            runs in parallel for a large number of potential sub-pairs, and then
            taper back down as it homes in on intersection coordinates, ending
            up with as many pairs as there are intersections.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following graphic applies this algorithm to a pair of cubic

            Self-intersection is dealt with in the same way, except we turn a
            curve into two or more curves first based on the inflection points.
            We then form all possible curve pairs with the resultant segments,
            and run exactly the same algorithm. All non-overlapping curve pairs
            will be removed after the first iteration, and the remaining steps
            home in on the curve's self-intersection points.

            De Casteljau's algorithm is the pivotal algorithm when it comes to
            Bézier curves. You can use it not just to split curves, but also to
            draw them efficiently (especially for high-order Bézier curves), as
            well as to come up with curves based on three points and a tangent.
            Particularly this last thing is really useful because it lets us
            "mould" a curve, by picking it up at some point, and dragging that
            point around to change the curve's shape.
          </p>
          <p>
            How does that work? Succinctly: we run de Casteljau's algorithm in
            reverse!
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to run de Casteljau's algorithm in reverse, we need a few
            basic things: a start and end point, a point on the curve that want
            to be moving around, which has an associated <em>t</em> value, and a
            point we've not explicitly talked about before, and as far as I know
            has no explicit name, but lives one iteration higher in the de
            Casteljau process then our on-curve point does. I like to call it
            "A" for reasons that will become obvious.
          </p>
          <p>
            So let's use graphics instead of text to see where this "A" is,
            because text only gets us so far: in the following graphic, click
            anywhere on the curves to see the identity information that we'll be
            using to run de Casteljau in reverse (you can manipulate the curve
            even after picking a point. Note the "ratio" value when you do so:
            does it change?):
          </p>
          <div class="figure">

          <p>Clicking anywhere on the curves shows us three things:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>our on-curve point; let's call that <b>B</b>,</li>
            <li>
              a point at the tip of B's "hat", on de Casteljau step up; let's
              call that <b>A</b>, and
            </li>
            <li>
              a point that we get by projecting B onto the start--end baseline;
              let's call that <b>C</b>.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            These three values A, B, and C hide an important identity formula
            for quadratic and cubic Bézier curves: for any point on the curve
            with some <em>t</em> value, the ratio distance of C along the
            baseline is fixed: if some <em>t</em> value sets up a C that is 20%
            away from the start and 80% away from the end, then it doesn't
            matter where the start, end, or control points are; for that
            <em>t</em> value, C will <em>always</em> lie at 20% from the start
            and 80% from the end point. Go ahead, pick an on-curve point in
            either graphic and then move all the other points around: if you
            only move the control points, start and end won't move, and so
            neither will C, and if you move either start or end point, C will
            move but its relative position will not change. The following
            function stays true:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"

            width="197px"
            height="16px"
          />
          <p>So that just leaves finding A.</p>
          <div class="note">
            <p>
              While that relation is fixed, the function <em>u(t)</em> differs
              depending on whether we're working with quadratic or cubic curves:
            </p>
            <img

            />
            <p>
              So, if we know the start and end coordinates, and we know the
              <em>t</em> value, we know C:
            </p>
            <div class="figure">

            </div>

            <p>
              Mouse-over the graphs to see the expression for C, given the
              <em>t</em> value at the mouse pointer.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            There's also another important bit of information that is inherent
            to the ABC values: while the distances between A and B, and B and C,
            are dynamic (based on where we put B), the <em>ratio</em> between
            the two distances is stable. Given some <em>t</em> value, the
            following always holds:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"

            height="39px"
          />
          <p>
            This leads to a pretty powerful bit of knowledge: merely by knowing
            the <em>t</em> value of some on curve point, we know where C has to
            be (as per the above note), and because we know B and C, and thus
            have the distance between them, we know where A has to be:
          </p>

            <p>
              Much like the <em>u(t)</em> function in the above note, the
              <em>ratio(t)</em> function depends on whether we're looking at
              quadratic or cubic curves. Their form is intrinsically related to
              the <em>u(t)</em> function in that they both come rolling out of
              the same function evaluation, explained over on

              Unfortunately, this trick only works for quadratic and cubic
              curves. Once we hit higher order curves, things become a lot less
              predictable; the "fixed point <em>C</em>" is no longer fixed,
              moving around as we move the control points, and projections of
              <em>B</em> onto the line between start and end may actually lie on
              that line before the start, or after the end, and there are no
              simple ratios that we can exploit.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            So: if we know B and its corresponding <em>t</em> value, then we
            know all the ABC values, which —together with a start and end
            coordinate— gives us the necessary information to reconstruct a
            curve's "de Casteljau skeleton", which means that two points and a
            value between 0 and 1, we can come up with a curve. And that opens
            up possibilities: curve manipulation by dragging an on-curve point,
            as well as curve fitting of "a bunch of coordinates". These are
            useful things, and we'll look at both in the next sections.

            Armed with knowledge of the "ABC" relation, we can now update a
            curve interactively, by letting people click anywhere on the curve,
            find the <em>t</em>-value matching that coordinate, and then letting
            them drag that point around. With every drag update we'll have a new
            point "B", which we can combine with the fixed point "C" to find our
            new point A. Once we have those, we can reconstruct the de Casteljau
            skeleton and thus construct a new curve with the same start/end
            points as the original curve, passing through the user-selected
            point B, with correct new control points.
          </p>

            onMouseDrag="{this.dragQB}"
            onMouseUp="{this.saveCurve}"
          />

          <p>
            <strong>Click-dragging the curve itself</strong> shows what we're
            using to compute the new coordinates: while dragging you will see
            the original point B and its corresponding <i>t</i>-value, the
            original point C for that <i>t</i>-value, as well as the new point
            B' based on the mouse cursor. Since we know the <i>t</i>-value for
            this configuration, we can compute the ABC ratio for this
            configuration, and we know that our new point A' should like at a
            distance:
          </p>
          <img

            height="36px"
          />
          <p>
            For quadratic curves, this means we're done, since the new point A'
            is equivalent to the new quadratic control point. For cubic curves,
            we need to do a little more work:
          </p>

            onMouseUp="{this.saveCurve}"
          />

          <p>
            To help understand what's going on, the cubic graphic shows the full
            de Casteljau construction "hull" when repositioning point B. We
            compute A' in exactly the same way as before, but we also record the
            final strut line that forms B in the original curve. Given A', B',
            and the endpoints e1 and e2 of the strut line relative to B', we can
            now compute where the new control points should be. Remember that B'
            lies on line e1--e2 at a distance <i>t</i>, because that's how
            Bézier curves work. In the same manner, we know the distance A--e1
            is only line-interval [0,t] of the full segment, and A--e2 is only
            line-interval [t,1], so constructing the new control points is
            fairly easy.
          </p>
          <p>First, we construct the one-level-of-de-Casteljau-up points:</p>

            height="75px"
          />
          <p>And then we can compute the new control points:</p>

          <p>And that's cubic curve manipulation.</p>

          <h1><a href="#pointcurves">Creating a curve from three points</a></h1>
          <p>
            Given the preceding section on curve manipulation, we can also
            generate quadratic and cubic curves from any three points. However,
            unlike circle-fitting, which requires just three points, Bézier
            curve fitting requires three points, as well as a <em>t</em> value,
            so we can figure out where point 'C' needs to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following graphic lets you place three points, and will use the
            preceding sections on the ABC ratio and curve construction to form a
            quadratic curve through them. You can move the points you've placed
            around by click-dragging, or try a new curve by drawing new points
            with pure clicks. (There's some freedom here, so for illustrative
            purposes we clamped <em>t</em> to simply be 0.5, lets us bypass some
            maths, since a <em>t</em> value of 0.5 always puts C in the middle
            of the start--end line segment)
          </p>

            draw="{this.drawQuadratic}"
            onClick="{this.onClick}"
          />

          <p>
            For cubic curves we also need some values to construct the "de
            Casteljau line through B" with, and that gives us quite a bit of
            choice. Since we've clamped <em>t</em> to 0.5, we'll set up a line
            through B parallel to the line start--end, with a length that is
            proportional to the length of the line B--C: the further away from
            the baseline B is, the wider its construction line will be, and so
            the more "bulby" the curve will look. This still gives us some
            freedom in terms of exactly how to scale the length of the
            construction line as we move B closer or further away from the
            baseline, so I simply picked some values that sort-of-kind-of look
            right in that if a circle through (start,B,end) forms a perfect
            hemisphere, the cubic curve constructed forms something close to a
            hemisphere, too, and if the points lie on a line, then the curve
            constructed has the control points very close to B, while still
            lying between B and the correct curve end point:

          <p>
            In each graphic, the blue parts are the values that we "just have"
            simply by setting up our three points, combined with our decision on
            which <em>t</em> value to use (and construction line orientation and
            length for cubic curves). There are of course many ways to determine
            a combination of <em>t</em> and tangent values that lead to a more
            "æsthetic" curve, but this will be left as an exercise to the
            reader, since there are many, and æsthetics are often quite
            personal.

            Given the previous section, one question you might have is "what if
            I don't want to guess <code>t</code> values?". After all, plenty of
            graphics packages do automated curve fitting, so how can we
            implement that in a way that just finds us reasonable
            <code>t</code> values all on its own?
          </p>
          <p>
            And really this is just a variation on the question "how do I get
            the curve through these X points?", so let's look at that.
            Specifically, let's look at the answer: "curve fitting". This is in
            fact a rather rich field in geometry, applying to anything from data
            modelling to path abstraction to "drawing", so there's a fair number
            of ways to do curve fitting, but we'll look at one of the most
            common approaches: something called a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares"
              >least squares</a
            >
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression"
              >polynomial regression</a
            >. In this approach, we look at the number of points we have in our
            data set, roughly determine what would be an appropriate order for a
            curve that would fit these points, and then tackle the question
            "given that we want an <code>nth</code> order curve, what are the
            coordinates we can find such that our curve is "off" by the least
            amount?".
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, there are many ways to determine how "off" points are from the
            curve, which is where that "least squares" term comes in. The most
            common tool in the toolbox is to minimise the
            <em>squared distance</em> between each point we have, and the
            corresponding point on the curve we end up "inventing". A curve with
            a snug fit will have zero distance between those two, and a bad fit
            will have non-zero distances between every such pair. It's a
            workable metric. You might wonder why we'd need to square, rather
            than just ensure that distance is a positive value (so that the
            total error is easy to compute by just summing distances) and the
            answer really is "because it tends to be a little better". There's
            lots of literature on the web if you want to deep-dive the specific
            merits of least squared error metrics versus least absolute error
            metrics, but those are <em>well</em> beyond the scope of this
            material.
          </p>
          <p>
            So let's look at what we end up with in terms of curve fitting if we
            start with the idea of performing least squares Bézier fitting.
            We're going to follow a procedure similar to the one described by
            Jim Herold over on his
            <a
              href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180403213813/http://jimherold.com/2012/04/20/least-squares-bezier-fit/"
              >"Least Squares Bézier Fit"</a
            >
            article, and end with some nice interactive graphics for doing some
            curve fitting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before we begin, we're going to use the curve in matrix form. In the
            <a href="#matrix">section on matrices</a>, I mentioned that some
            things are easier if we use the matrix representation of a Bézier
            curve rather than its calculus form, and this is one of those
            things.
          </p>
          <p>
            As such, the first step in the process is expressing our Bézier
            curve as powers/coefficients/coordinate matrix
            <strong>T x M x C</strong>, by expanding the Bézier functions.
          </p>
          <div class="note">
            <h2>Revisiting the matrix representation</h2>
            <p>
              Rewriting Bézier functions to matrix form is fairly easy, if you
              first expand the function, and then arrange them into a multiple
              line form, where each line corresponds to a power of t, and each
              column is for a specific coefficient. First, we expand the
              function:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/bd8e8e294eec10d2bf6ef857c7c0c2c2.svg"
              width="295px"
              height="43px"
            />
            <p>
              And then we (trivially) rearrange the terms across multiple lines:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/2b8334727d3b004c6e87263fec6b32b7.svg"
              width="216px"
              height="64px"
            />
            <p>
              This rearrangement has "factors of t" at each row (the first row
              is t⁰, i.e. "1", the second row is t¹, i.e. "t", the third row is
              t²) and "coefficient" at each column (the first column is all
              terms involving "a", the second all terms involving "b", the third
              all terms involving "c").
            </p>
            <p>
              With that arrangement, we can easily decompose this as a matrix
              multiplication:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/94acb5850778dcb16c2ba3cfa676f537.svg"
              width="572px"
              height="53px"
            />
            <p>
              We can do the same for the cubic curve, of course. We know the
              base function for cubics:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/7eada6f12045423de24d9a2ab8e293b1.svg"
              width="355px"
              height="19px"
            />
            <p>So we write out the expansion and rearrange:</p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/875ca8eea72e727ccb881b4c0b6a3224.svg"
              width="248px"
              height="87px"
            />
            <p>Which we can then decompose:</p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/03ec73258d5c95eed39a2ea8665e0b07.svg"
              width="404px"
              height="72px"
            />
            <p>
              And, of course, we can do this for quartic curves too (skipping
              the expansion step):
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/9151c0fdf9689ee598a2d029ab2ffe34.svg"
              width="491px"
              height="92px"
            />
            <p>
              And so and on so on. Now, let's see how to use these
              <strong>T</strong>, <strong>M</strong>, and <strong>C</strong>, to
              do some curve fitting.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Let's get started: we're going to assume we picked the right order
            curve: for <code>n</code> points we're fitting an <code>n-1</code
            ><sup>th</sup> order curve, so we "start" with a vector
            <strong>P</strong> that represents the coordinates we already know,
            and for which we want to do curve fitting:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/2bef3da3828d63d690460ce9947dbde2.svg"
            width="63px"
            height="73px"
          />
          <p>
            Next, we need to figure out appropriate <code>t</code> values for
            each point in the curve, because we need something that lets us tie
            "the actual coordinate" to "some point on the curve". There's a fair
            number of different ways to do this (and a large part of optimizing
            "the perfect fit" is about picking appropriate
            <code>t</code> values), but in this case let's look at two "obvious"
            choices:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>equally spaced <code>t</code> values, and</li>
            <li>
              <code>t</code> values that align with distance along the polygon.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The first one is really simple: if we have <code>n</code> points,
            then we'll just assign each point <code>i</code> a
            <code>t</code> value of <code>(i-1)/(n-1)</code>. So if we have four
            points, the first point will have <code>t=(1-1)/(4-1)=0/3</code>,
            the second point will have <code>t=(2-1)/(4-1)=1/3</code>, the third
            point will have <code>t=2/3</code>, and the last point will be
            <code>t=1</code>. We're just straight up spacing the
            <code>t</code> values to match the number of points we have.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second one is a little more interesting: since we're doing
            polynomial regression, we might as well exploit the fact that our
            base coordinates just constitute a collection of line segments. At
            the first point, we're fixing t=0, and the last point, we want t=1,
            and anywhere in between we're simply going to say that
            <code>t</code> is equal to the distance along the polygon, scaled to
            the [0,1] domain.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get these values, we first compute the general "distance along
            the polygon" matrix:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/78b8ba1aba2e4c9ad3f7890299c90152.svg"
            width="395px"
            height="40px"
          />
          <p>
            Where <code>length()</code> is literally just that: the length of
            the line segment between the point we're looking at, and the
            previous point. This isn't quite enough, of course: we still need to
            make sure that all the values between <code>i=1</code> and
            <code>i=n</code> fall in the [0,1] interval, so we need to scale all
            values down by whatever the total length of the polygon is:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/08f4beaebf83dca594ad125bdca7e436.svg"
            width="272px"
            height="55px"
          />
          <p>
            And now we can move on to the actual "curve fitting" part: what we
            want is a function that lets us compute "ideal" control point values
            such that if we build a Bézier curve with them, that curve passes
            through all our original points. Or, failing that, have an overall
            error distance that is as close to zero as we can get it. So, let's
            write out what the error distance looks like.
          </p>
          <p>
            As mentioned before, this function is really just "the distance
            between the actual coordinate, and the coordinate that the curve
            evaluates to for the associated <code>t</code> value", which we'll
            square to get rid of any pesky negative signs:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/7e5d59272621baf942bc722208ce70c2.svg"
            width="177px"
            height="23px"
          />
          <p>
            Since this function only deals with individual coordinates, we'll
            need to sum over all coordinates in order to get the full error
            function. So, we literally just do that; the total error function is
            simply the sum of all these individual errors:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/ab334858d3fa309cc1a5ba535a2ca168.svg"
            width="195px"
            height="41px"
          />
          <p>
            And here's the trick that justifies using matrices: while we can
            work with individual values using calculus, with matrices we can
            compute as many values as we make our matrices big, all at the "same
            time", We can replace the individual terms p<sub>i</sub> with the
            full <strong>P</strong> coordinate matrix, and we can replace
            Bézier(s<sub>i</sub>) with the matrix representation
            <strong>T x M x C</strong> we talked about before, which gives us:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/2d42758fba3370f52191306752c2705c.svg"
            width="141px"
            height="21px"
          />
          <p>
            In which we can replace the rather cumbersome "squaring" operation
            with a more conventional matrix equivalent:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/5f7fcb86ae1c19612b9fe02e23229e31.svg"
            width="225px"
            height="21px"
          />
          <p>
            Here, the letter <code>T</code> is used instead of the number 2, to
            represent the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose"
              >matrix transpose</a
            >; each row in the original matrix becomes a column in the
            transposed matrix instead (row one becomes column one, row two
            becomes column two, and so on).
          </p>
          <p>
            This leaves one problem: <strong>T</strong> isn't actually the
            matrix we want: we don't want symbolic <code>t</code> values, we
            want the actual numerical values that we computed for
            <strong>S</strong>, so we need to form a new matrix, which we'll
            call 𝕋, that makes use of those, and then use that 𝕋 instead of
            <strong>T</strong> in our error function:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/6202d7bd150c852b432d807c40fb1647.svg"
            width="201px"
            height="96px"
          />
          <p>
            Which, because of the first and last values in <strong>S</strong>,
            means:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/4ffad56e281ee79d0688e93033429f0a.svg"
            width="212px"
            height="92px"
          />
          <p>
            Now we can properly write out the error function as matrix
            operations:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/8d09f2be2c6db79ee966f170ffc25815.svg"
            width="231px"
            height="21px"
          />
          <p>
            So, we have our error function: we now need to figure out the
            expression for where that function has minimal value, e.g. where the
            error between the true coordinates and the coordinates generated by
            the curve fitting is smallest. Like in standard calculus, this
            requires taking the derivative, and determining where that
            derivative is zero:
          </p>
          <img

            <h2>Where did this derivative come from?</h2>
            <p>
              That... is a good question. In fact, when trying to run through
              this approach, I ran into the same question! And you know what? I
              straight up had no idea. I'm decent enough at calculus, I'm decent
              enough at linear algebra, and I just don't know.

              So I did what I always do when I don't understand something: I

              hoped to receive.

            <p>
              Is that answer useful to you? Probably: no. At least, not unless
              you like understanding maths on a recreational level. And I do
              mean maths in general, not just basic algebra. But it does help in
              giving us a reference in case you ever wonder "Hang on. Why was
              that true?". There are answers. They might just require some time
              to come to understand.

            Now, given the above derivative, we can rearrange the terms
            (following the rules of matrix algebra) so that we end up with an
            expression for <strong>C</strong>:

            Here, the "to the power negative one" is the notation for the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix"
              >matrix inverse</a
            >. But that's all we have to do: we're done. Starting with
            <strong>P</strong> and inventing some <code>t</code> values based on
            the polygon the coordinates in <strong>P</strong> define, we can
            compute the corresponding Bézier coordinates <strong>C</strong> that
            specify a curve that goes through our points. Or, if it can't go
            through them exactly, as near as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            So before we try that out, how much code is involved in implementing
            this? Honestly, that answer depends on how much you're going to be
            writing yourself. If you already have a matrix maths library
            available, then really not that much code at all. On the other hand,
            if you are writing this from scratch, you're going to have to write
            some utility functions for doing your matrix work for you, so it's
            really anywhere from 50 lines of code to maybe 200 lines of code.
            Not a bad price to pay for being able to fit curves to prespecified
            coordinates.
          </p>
          <p>
            So let's try it out! The following graphic lets you place points,
            and will start computing exact-fit curves once you've placed at
            least three. You can click for more points, and the code will simply
            try to compute an exact fit using a Bezier curve of the appropriate
            order. Four points? Cubic Bezier. Five points? Quartic. And so on.
            Of course, this does break down at some point: depending on where
            you place your points, it might become mighty hard for the fitter to
            find an exact fit, and things might actually start looking horribly
            off once you hit 10<sup>th</sup> or higher order curves. But it
            might not!
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <Graphic
              title="Fitting a Bézier curve"

            </Graphic>
          </div>

          <p>
            You'll note there is a convenient "toggle" buttons that lets you
            toggle between equidistance <code>t</code> values, and distance
            ratio along the polygon. Arguably more interesting is that once you
            have points to abstract a curve, you also get
            <em>direct control</em> over the time values through sliders for
            each, because if the time values are our degree of freedom, you
            should be able to freely manipulate them and see what the effect on
            your curve is.

            Taking an excursion to different splines, the other common design
            curve is the

              >Catmull-Rom spline</a
            >. Now, a Catmull-Rom spline is a form of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_Hermite_spline"
              >cubic Hermite spline</a
            >, and as it so happens the cubic Bézier curve is <em>also</em> a
            cubic Hermite spline, so maybe... maybe we can convert one into the
            other, and back, with some simple substitutions?
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike Bézier curves, Catmull-Rom splines pass through each point
            used to define the curve, except the first and last, which makes
            sense if you read the "natural language" description for how a
            Catmull-Rom spline works: a Catmull-Rom spline is a curve that, at
            each point P<sub>x</sub>, has a tangent along the line P<sub
              >x-1</sub
            >
            to P<sub>x+1</sub>. The curve runs from points P<sub>2</sub> to
            P<sub>n-1</sub>, and has a "tension" that determines how fast the
            curve passes through each point. The lower the tension, the faster
            the curve goes through each point, and the bigger its local tangent
            is.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll be showing the conversion to and from Catmull-Rom curves for
            the tension that the Processing language uses for its Catmull-Rom
            algorithm.
          </p>
          <p>
            We start with showing the Catmull-Rom matrix form, which looks
            similar to the Bézier matrix form, with slightly different values in
            the matrix:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/9215d05705c8e8a7ebd718ae6f690371.svg"
            width="409px"
            height="75px"
          />
          <p>
            However, there's something funny going on here: the coordinate
            column matrix looks weird. The reason is that Catmull-Rom curves are
            actually curve segments that are described by two coordinate points,
            and two tangents; the curve starts at coordinate V1, and ends at
            coordinate V2, with the curve "departing" V1 with a tangent vector
            V'1 and "arriving" at V2 with tangent vector V'2.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is not particularly useful if we want to draw Catmull-Rom
            curves in the same way we draw Bézier curves, i.e. by providing four
            points. However, we can fairly easily go from the former to the
            latter, but it's going to require some linear algebra, so if you
            just want to know how to convert between the two coordinate systems:
            skip the following bit.
          </p>
          <p>
            But... if you want to know <em>why</em> that conversion works, let's
            do some maths!
          </p>
          <div class="note">
            <h2>Deriving the conversion formulae</h2>
            <p>
              In order to convert between Catmull-Rom curves and Bézier curves,
              we need to know two things. Firstly, how to express the
              Catmull-Rom curve using a "set of four coordinates", rather than a
              mix of coordinates and tangents, and secondly, how to convert
              those Catmull-Rom coordinates to and from Bézier form.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, let's start with the first, where we want to satisfy the
              following equality:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/1811b59c5ab9233f08590396e5d03303.svg"
              width="187px"
              height="83px"
            />
            <p>
              This mapping says that in order to map a Catmull-Rom "point +
              tangent" vector to something based on an "all coordinates" vector,
              we need to determine the mapping matrix such that applying
              <em>T</em> yields P2 as start point, P3 as end point, and two
              tangents based on the lines between P1 and P3, and P2 nd P4,
              respectively.
            </p>
            <p>Computing <em>T</em> is really more "arranging the numbers":</p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/4d524810417b4caffedd13af23135f5b.svg"
              width="591px"
              height="83px"
            />
            <p>Thus:</p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/f41487aff3e34fafd5d4ee5979f133f1.svg"
              width="143px"
              height="81px"
            />
            <p>
              However, we're not <em>quite</em> done, because Catmull-Rom curves
              have a parameter called "tension", written as τ ("tau"), which is
              a scaling factor for the tangent vectors: the bigger the tension,
              the smaller the tangents, and the smaller the tension, the bigger
              the tangents. As such, the tension factor goes in the denominator
              for the tangents, and before we continue, let's add that tension
              factor into both our coordinate vector representation, and mapping
              matrix <em>T</em>:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/06ae1e3fdc660e59d618e0760e8e9ab5.svg"
              width="285px"
              height="84px"
            />
            <p>
              With the mapping matrix properly done, let's rewrite the "point +
              tangent" Catmull-Rom matrix form to a matrix form in terms of four
              coordinates, and see what we end up with:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/cc1e2ff43350c32f0ae9ba9a7652b8fb.svg"
              width="409px"
              height="75px"
            />
            <p>
              Replace point/tangent vector with the expression for
              all-coordinates:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/f08e34395ce2812276fd70548f805041.svg"
              width="549px"
              height="81px"
            />
            <p>and merge the matrices:</p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/f2b2a16a41d134ce0dfd544ab77ff25e.svg"
              width="455px"
              height="84px"
            />
            <p>
              This looks a lot like the Bézier matrix form, which as we saw in
              the chapter on Bézier curves, should look like this:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/8f56909fcb62b8eef18b9b9559575c13.svg"
              width="353px"
              height="73px"
            />
            <p>
              So, if we want to express a Catmull-Rom curve using a Bézier
              curve, we'll need to turn this Catmull-Rom bit:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/b21386f86bef8894f108c5441dad10de.svg"
              width="227px"
              height="84px"
            />
            <p>Into something that looks like this:</p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/78ac9df086ec19147414359369b563fc.svg"
              width="167px"
              height="73px"
            />
            <p>
              And the way we do that is with a fairly straight forward bit of
              matrix rewriting. We start with the equality we need to ensure:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/a47b072a325812ac4f0ff52c22792588.svg"
              width="440px"
              height="84px"
            />
            <p>
              Then we remove the coordinate vector from both sides without
              affecting the equality:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/841fb6a2a035c9bcf5a2d46f2a67709b.svg"
              width="353px"
              height="84px"
            />
            <p>
              Then we can "get rid of" the Bézier matrix on the right by
              left-multiply both with the inverse of the Bézier matrix:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/cbdd46d5e2e1a6202ef46fb03711ebe4.svg"
              width="657px"
              height="88px"
            />
            <p>
              A matrix times its inverse is the matrix equivalent of 1, and
              because "something times 1" is the same as "something", so we can
              just outright remove any matrix/inverse pair:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/3ea54fe939d076f8db605c5b480e7db0.svg"
              width="369px"
              height="88px"
            />
            <p>
              And now we're <em>basically</em> done. We just multiply those two
              matrices and we know what <em>V</em> is:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"

            />
            <p>
              We now have the final piece of our function puzzle. Let's run

          </h1>
          <p>
            Now, we saw how to fit a Bézier curve to three points, but if
            Catmull-Rom curves go through points, why can't we just use those to
            do curve fitting, instead?
          </p>
          <p>
            As a matter of fact, we can, but there's a difference between the
            kind of curve fitting we did in the previous section, and the kind
            of curve fitting that we can do with Catmull-Rom curves. In the
            previous section we came up with a single curve that goes through
            three points. There was a decent amount of maths and computation
            involved, and the end result was three or four coordinates that
            described a single curve, depending on whether we were fitting a
            quadratic or cubic curve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using Catmull-Rom curves, we need virtually no computation, but even
            though we end up with one Catmull-Rom curve of <i>n</i> points, in
            order to draw the equivalent curve using cubic Bézier curves we need
            a massive <i>3n-2</i> points (and that's without double-counting
            points that are shared by consecutive cubic curves).
          </p>
          <p>
            In the following graphic, on the left we see three points that we
            want to draw a Catmull-Rom curve through (which we can move around
            freely, by the way), with in the second panel some of the
            "interesting" Catmull-Rom information: in black there's the baseline
            start--end, which will act as tangent orientation for the curve at
            point p2. We also see a virtual point p0 and p4, which are initially
            just point p2 reflected over the baseline. However, by using the up
            and down cursor key we can offset these points parallel to the
            baseline. Why would we want to do this? Because the line p0--p2 acts
            as departure tangent at p1, and the line p2--p4 acts as arrival
            tangent at p3. Play around with the graphic a bit to get an idea of
            what all of that meant:

          <p>
            As should be obvious by now, Catmull-Rom curves are great for
            "fitting a curvature to some points", but if we want to convert that
            curve to Bézier form we're going to end up with a lot of separate
            (but visually joined) Bézier curves. Depending on what we want to
            do, that'll be either unnecessary work, or exactly what we want:
            which it is depends entirely on you.

            Much like lines can be chained together to form polygons, Bézier
            curves can be chained together to form poly-Béziers, and the only
            trick required is to make sure that:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              the end point of each section is the starting point of the
              following section, and
            </li>
            <li>the derivatives across that dual point line up.</li>
          </ol>

            2.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll cover three forms of poly-Bézier curves in this section.
            First, we'll look at the kind that just follows point 1. where the
            end point of a segment is the same point as the start point of the
            next segment. This leads to poly-Béziers that are pretty hard to
            work with, but they're the easiest to implement:
          </p>
          <Graphic
            title="Unlinked quadratic poly-Bézier"

          <Graphic
            title="Unlinked cubic poly-Bézier"
            setup="{this.setupCubic}"
            draw="{this.draw}"
          />

          <p>
            Dragging the control points around only affects the curve segments
            that the control point belongs to, and moving an on-curve point
            leaves the control points where they are, which is not the most
            useful for practical modelling purposes. So, let's add in the logic
            we need to make things a little better. We'll start by linking up
            control points by ensuring that the "incoming" derivative at an
            on-curve point is the same as it's "outgoing" derivative:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/408dd95905a5f001179c4da6051e49c5.svg"
            width="124px"
            height="17px"
          />
          <p>
            We can effect this quite easily, because we know that the vector
            from a curve's last control point to its last on-curve point is
            equal to the derivative vector. If we want to ensure that the first
            control point of the next curve matches that, all we have to do is
            mirror that last control point through the last on-curve point. And
            mirroring any point A through any point B is really simple:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"

            width="304px"
            height="40px"
          />
          <p>
            So let's implement that and see what it gets us. The following two
            graphics show a quadratic and a cubic poly-Bézier curve again, but
            this time moving the control points around moves others, too.
            However, you might see something unexpected going on for quadratic
            curves...

            draw="{this.draw}"
            onMouseMove="{this.linkDerivatives}"
          />

          <p>
            As you can see, quadratic curves are particularly ill-suited for
            poly-Bézier curves, as all the control points are effectively
            linked. Move one of them, and you move all of them. Not only that,
            but if we move the on-curve points, it's possible to get a situation
            where a control point's positions is different depending on whether
            it's the reflection of its left or right neighbouring control point:
            we can't even form a proper rule-conforming curve! This means that
            we cannot use quadratic poly-Béziers for anything other than really,
            really simple shapes. And even then, they're probably the wrong
            choice. Cubic curves are pretty decent, but the fact that the
            derivatives are linked means we can't manipulate curves as well as
            we might if we relaxed the constraints a little.
          </p>
          <p>So: let's relax the requirement a little.</p>
          <p>
            We can change the constraint so that we still preserve the
            <em>angle</em> of the derivatives across sections (so transitions
            from one section to the next will still look natural), but give up
            the requirement that they should also have the same
            <em>vector length</em>. Doing so will give us a much more useful
            kind of poly-Bézier curve:
          </p>
          <Graphic
            title="Angularly connected quadratic poly-Bézier"
            setup="{this.setupQuadratic}"
            draw="{this.draw}"
            onMouseMove="{this.linkDirection}"
          />
          <Graphic
            title="Angularly connected cubic poly-Bézier"

            draw="{this.draw}"
            onMouseMove="{this.linkDirection}"
          />

          <p>
            Cubic curves are now better behaved when it comes to dragging
            control points around, but the quadratic poly-Bézier still has the
            problem that moving one control points will move the control points
            and may ending up defining "the next" control point in a way that
            doesn't work. Quadratic curves really aren't very useful to work
            with...
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, we also want to make sure that moving the on-curve
            coordinates preserves the relative positions of the associated
            control points. With that, we get to the kind of curve control that
            you might be familiar with from applications like Photoshop,
            Inkscape, Blender, etc.
          </p>
          <Graphic
            title="Standard connected quadratic poly-Bézier"
            setup="{this.setupQuadratic}"
            draw="{this.draw}"

            onMouseDown="{this.bufferPoints}"
            onMouseMove="{this.modelCurve}"
          />

          <p>
            Again, we see that cubic curves are now rather nice to work with,
            but quadratic curves have a new, very serious problem: we can move
            an on-curve point in such a way that we can't compute what needs to
            "happen next". Move the top point down, below the left and right
            points, for instance. There is no way to preserve correct control
            points without a kink at the bottom point. Quadratic curves: just
            not that good...
          </p>
          <p>
            A final improvement is to offer fine-level control over which points
            behave which, so that you can have "kinks" or individually
            controlled segments when you need them, with nicely well-behaved
            curves for the rest of the path. Implementing that, is left as an
            exercise for the reader.

        <section id="shapes">
          <h1><a href="#shapes">Boolean shape operations</a></h1>
          <p>
            We can apply the topics covered so far in this primer to effect
            boolean shape operations: getting the union, intersection, or
            exclusion, between two or more shapes that involve Bézier curves.
            For simplicity (well... sort of, more homogeneity), we'll be looking
            at poly-Bézier shapes only, but a shape that consists of a mix of
            lines and Bézier curves is technically a simplification. (Although
            it does mean we need to write a definition for the class of shapes
            that mix lines and Bézier curves. Since poly-Bézier curves are a
            superset, we'll be using those in the following examples.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The procedure for performing boolean operations consists, broadly,
            of four steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Find the intersection points between both shapes,</li>
            <li>
              cut up the shapes into multiple sections between these
              intersections,
            </li>
            <li>
              discard any section that isn't part of the desired operation's
              resultant shape, and
            </li>
            <li>link up the remaining sections to form the new shape.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Finding all intersections between two poly-Bézier curves, or any
            poly-line-section shape, is similar to the iterative algorithm
            discussed in the section on curve/curve intersection. For each
            segment in the poly-Bézier curve, we check whether its bounding box
            overlaps with any of the segment bounding boxes in the other
            poly-Bézier curve. If so, we run normal intersection detection.
          </p>
          <p>
            After finding all intersection points, we split up our poly-Bézier
            curves, and make sure to record which of the newly formed
            poly-Bézier curves might potentially link up at the points we split
            the originals up at. This will let us quickly glue poly-Bézier
            curves back together after the next step.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once we have all the new poly-Bézier curves, we run the first step
            of the desired boolean operation.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Union: discard all poly-Bézier curves that lie "inside" our union
              of our shapes. E.g. if we want the union of two overlapping
              circles, the resulting shape is the outline.
            </li>
            <li>
              Intersection: discard all poly-Bézier curves that lie "outside"
              the intersection of the two shapes. E.g. if we want the
              intersection of two overlapping circles, the resulting shape is
              the tapered ellipse where they overlap.
            </li>
            <li>
              Exclusion: none of the sections are discarded, but we will need to
              link the shapes back up in a special way. Flip any section that
              would qualify for removal under UNION rules.

            The main complication in the outlined procedure here is determining
            how sections qualify in terms of being "inside" and "outside" of our
            shapes. For this, we need to be able to perform point-in-shape
            detection, for which we'll use a classic algorithm: getting the
            "crossing number" by using ray casting, and then testing for
            "insidedness" by applying the
            <a
              href="http://folk.uio.no/bjornw/doc/bifrost-ref/bifrost-ref-12.html"
              >even-odd rule</a
            >: For any point and any shape, we can cast a ray from our point, to
            some point that we know lies outside of the shape (such as a corner
            of our drawing surface). We then count how many times that line
            crosses our shape (remember that we can perform line/curve
            intersection detection quite easily). If the number of times it
            crosses the shape's outline is even, the point did not actually lie
            inside our shape. If the number of intersections is odd, our point
            did lie inside out shape. With that knowledge, we can decide whether
            to treat a section that such a point lies on "needs removal" (under
            union rules), "needs preserving" (under intersection rules), or
            "needs flipping" (under exclusion rules).

            These operations are expensive, and implementing your own code for
            this is generally a bad idea if there is already a geometry package
            available for your language of choice. In this case, for JavaScript
            the most excellent <a href="http://paperjs.org">Paper.js</a> already
            comes with all the code in place to perform efficient boolean shape
            operations, so rather that implement an inferior version here, I can
            strongly recommend the Paper.js library if you intend to do any
            boolean shape work.

          <p>
            The following graphic shows Paper.js doing its thing for two shapes:
            one static, and one that is linked to your mouse pointer. If you
            move the mouse around, you'll see how the shape intersections are
            resolved. The base shapes are outlined in blue, and the boolean
            result is coloured red.

            Say we have a Bézier curve and some point, not on the curve, of
            which we want to know which <code>t</code> value on the curve gives
            us an on-curve point closest to our off-curve point. Or: say we want
            to find the projection of a random point onto a curve. How do we do
            that?
          </p>
          <p>
            If the Bézier curve is of low enough order, we might be able to
            <a

              >work out the maths for how to do this</a
            >, and get a perfect <code>t</code> value back, but in general this
            is an incredibly hard problem and the easiest solution is, really, a
            numerical approach again. We'll be finding our ideal
            <code>t</code> value using a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm"
              >binary search</a
            >. First, we do a coarse distance-check based on
            <code>t</code> values associated with the curve's "to draw"
            coordinates (using a lookup table, or LUT). This is pretty fast.
            Then we run this algorithm:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              with the <code>t</code> value we found, start with some small
              interval around <code>t</code> (1/length_of_LUT on either side is
              a reasonable start),
            </li>
            <li>
              if the distance to <code>t ± interval/2</code> is larger than the
              distance to <code>t</code>, try again with the interval reduced to
              half its original length.
            </li>
            <li>
              if the distance to <code>t ± interval/2</code> is smaller than the
              distance to <code>t</code>, replace <code>t</code> with the
              smaller-distance value.
            </li>
            <li>
              after reducing the interval, or changing <code>t</code>, go back
              to step 1.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            We keep repeating this process until the interval is small enough to
            claim the difference in precision found is irrelevant for the
            purpose we're trying to find <code>t</code> for. In this case, I'm
            arbitrarily fixing it at 0.0001.

          <p>
            Perhaps you're like me, and you've been writing various small
            programs that use Bézier curves in some way or another, and at some
            point you make the step to implementing path extrusion. But you
            don't want to do it pixel based; you want to stay in the vector
            world. You find that extruding lines is relatively easy, and tracing
            outlines is coming along nicely (although junction caps and fillets
            are a bit of a hassle), and then you decide to do things properly
            and add Bézier curves to the mix. Now you have a problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike lines, you can't simply extrude a Bézier curve by taking a
            copy and moving it around, because of the curvatures; rather than a
            uniform thickness, you get an extrusion that looks too thin in
            places, if you're lucky, but more likely will self-intersect. The
            trick, then, is to scale the curve, rather than simply copying it.
            But how do you scale a Bézier curve?
          </p>
          <p>
            Bottom line: <strong>you can't</strong>. So you cheat. We're not
            going to do true curve scaling, or rather curve offsetting, because
            that's impossible. Instead we're going to try to generate 'looks
            good enough' offset curves.

            <h3>"What do you mean, you can't? Prove it."</h3>
            <p>
              First off, when I say "you can't," what I really mean is "you
              can't offset a Bézier curve with another Bézier curve", not even
              by using a really high order curve. You can find the function that
              describes the offset curve, but it won't be a polynomial, and as
              such it cannot be represented as a Bézier curve, which
              <strong>has</strong> to be a polynomial. Let's look at why this
              is:
            </p>
            <p>
              From a mathematical point of view, an offset curve
              <code>O(t)</code> is a curve such that, given our original curve
              <code>B(t)</code>, any point on <code>O(t)</code> is a fixed
              distance <code>d</code> away from coordinate <code>B(t)</code>. So
              let's math that:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/1d4be24e5896dce3c16c8e71f9cc8881.svg"
              width="108px"
              height="16px"
            />
            <p>
              However, we're working in 2D, and <code>d</code> is a single
              value, so we want to turn it into a vector. If we want a point
              distance <code>d</code> "away" from the curve
              <code>B(t)</code> then what we really mean is that we want a point
              at <code>d</code> times the "normal vector" from point
              <code>B(t)</code>, where the "normal" is a vector that runs
              perpendicular ("at a right angle") to the tangent at
              <code>B(t)</code>. Easy enough:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/5bfee4f2ae27304475673d0596e42f9a.svg"
              width="151px"
              height="16px"
            />
            <p>
              Now this still isn't very useful unless we know what the formula
              for <code>N(t)</code> is, so let's find out.
              <code>N(t)</code> runs perpendicular to the original curve
              tangent, and we know that the tangent is simply
              <code>B'(t)</code>, so we could just rotate that 90 degrees and be
              done with it. However, we need to ensure that
              <code>N(t)</code> has the same magnitude for every <code>t</code>,
              or the offset curve won't be at a uniform distance, thus not being
              an offset curve at all. The easiest way to guarantee this is to
              make sure <code>N(t)</code> always has length 1, which we can
              achieve by dividing <code>B'(t)</code> by its magnitude:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/fa6c243de2aa78b7451e0086848dfdfc.svg"
              width="120px"
              height="40px"
            />
            <p>
              Determining the length requires computing an arc length, and this
              is where things get Tricky with a capital T. First off, to compute
              arc length from some start <code>a</code> to end <code>b</code>,
              we must use the formula we saw earlier. Noting that "length" is
              usually denoted with double vertical bars:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/b262e50c085815421d94e120fc17f1c8.svg"
              width="169px"
              height="36px"
            />
            <p>
              So if we want the length of the tangent, we plug in
              <code>B'(t)</code>, with <code>t = 0</code> as start and
              <code>t = 1</code> as end:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"
              src="images/latex/1d586b939b44ff9bdb42562a12ac2779.svg"
              width="209px"
              height="36px"
            />
            <p>
              And that's where things go wrong. It doesn't even really matter
              what the second derivative for <code>B(t)</code> is, that square
              root is screwing everything up, because it turns our nice
              polynomials into things that are no longer polynomials.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a small class of polynomials where the square root is
              also a polynomial, but they're utterly useless to us: any
              polynomial with unweighted binomial coefficients has a square root
              that is also a polynomial. Now, you might think that Bézier curves
              are just fine because they do, but they don't; remember that only
              the <strong>base</strong> function has binomial coefficients.
              That's before we factor in our coordinates, which turn it into a
              non-binomial polygon. The only way to make sure the functions stay
              binomial is to make all our coordinates have the same value. And
              that's not a curve, that's a point. We can already create offset
              curves for points, we call them circles, and they have much
              simpler functions than Bézier curves.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, since the tangent length isn't a polynomial, the normalised
              tangent won't be a polynomial either, which means
              <code>N(t)</code> won't be a polynomial, which means that
              <code>d</code> times <code>N(t)</code> won't be a polynomial,
              which means that, ultimately, <code>O(t)</code> won't be a
              polynomial, which means that even if we can determine the function
              for <code>O(t)</code> just fine (and that's far from trivial!), it
              simply cannot be represented as a Bézier curve.
            </p>
            <p>
              And that's one reason why Bézier curves are tricky: there are
              actually a <em>lot</em> of curves that cannot be represented as a
              Bézier curve at all. They can't even model their own offset
              curves. They're weird that way. So how do all those other programs
              do it? Well, much like we're about to do, they cheat. We're going
              to approximate an offset curve in a way that will look relatively
              close to what the real offset curve would look like, if we could
              compute it.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            So, you cannot offset a Bézier curve perfectly with another Bézier
            curve, no matter how high-order you make that other Bézier curve.
            However, we can chop up a curve into "safe" sub-curves (where "safe"
            means that all the control points are always on a single side of the
            baseline, and the midpoint of the curve at <code>t=0.5</code> is
            roughly in the center of the polygon defined by the curve
            coordinates) and then point-scale each sub-curve with respect to its
            scaling origin (which is the intersection of the point normals at
            the start and end points).
          </p>
          <p>
            A good way to do this reduction is to first find the curve's extreme
            points, as explained in the earlier section on curve extremities,
            and use these as initial splitting points. After this initial split,
            we can check each individual segment to see if it's "safe enough"
            based on where the center of the curve is. If the on-curve point for
            <code>t=0.5</code> is too far off from the center, we simply split
            the segment down the middle. Generally this is more than enough to
            end up with safe segments.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following graphics show off curve offsetting, and you can use
            your up and down arrow keys to control the distance at which the
            curve gets offset. The curve first gets reduced to safe segments,
            each of which is then offset at the desired distance. Especially for
            simple curves, particularly easily set up for quadratic curves, no
            reduction is necessary, but the more twisty the curve gets, the more
            the curve needs to be reduced in order to get segments that can
            safely be scaled.

          <p>
            You may notice that this may still lead to small 'jumps' in the
            sub-curves when moving the curve around. This is caused by the fact
            that we're still performing a naive form of offsetting, moving the
            control points the same distance as the start and end points. If the
            curve is large enough, this may still lead to incorrect offsets.

        <section id="graduatedoffset">
          <h1><a href="#graduatedoffset">Graduated curve offsetting</a></h1>
          <p>
            What if we want to do graduated offsetting, starting at some
            distance <code>s</code> but ending at some other distance
            <code>e</code>? Well, if we can compute the length of a curve (which
            we can if we use the Legendre-Gauss quadrature approach) then we can
            also determine how far "along the line" any point on the curve is.
            With that knowledge, we can offset a curve so that its offset curve
            is not uniformly wide, but graduated between with two different
            offset widths at the start and end.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like normal offsetting we cut up our curve in sub-curves, and then
            check at which distance along the original curve each sub-curve
            starts and ends, as well as to which point on the curve each of the
            control points map. This gives us the distance-along-the-curve for
            each interesting point in the sub-curve. If we call the total length
            of all sub-curves seen prior to seeing "the current" sub-curve
            <code>S</code> (and if the current sub-curve is the first one,
            <code>S</code> is zero), and we call the full length of our original
            curve <code>L</code>, then we get the following graduation values:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              start: map <code>S</code> from interval (<code>0,L</code>) to
              interval <code>(s,e)</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              c1: <code>map(&lt;strong&gt;S+d1&lt;/strong&gt;, 0,L, s,e)</code>,
              d1 = distance along curve to projection of c1
            </li>
            <li>
              c2: <code>map(&lt;strong&gt;S+d2&lt;/strong&gt;, 0,L, s,e)</code>,

            At each of the relevant points (start, end, and the projections of
            the control points onto the curve) we know the curve's normal, so
            offsetting is simply a matter of taking our original point, and
            moving it along the normal vector by the offset distance for each
            point. Doing so will give us the following result (these have with a
            starting width of 0, and an end width of 40 pixels, but can be
            controlled with your up and down arrow keys):

          <h1><a href="#circles">Circles and quadratic Bézier curves</a></h1>
          <p>
            Circles and Bézier curves are very different beasts, and circles are
            infinitely easier to work with than Bézier curves. Their formula is
            much simpler, and they can be drawn more efficiently. But, sometimes
            you don't have the luxury of using circles, or ellipses, or arcs.
            Sometimes, all you have are Bézier curves. For instance, if you're
            doing font design, fonts have no concept of geometric shapes, they
            only know straight lines, and Bézier curves. OpenType fonts with
            TrueType outlines only know quadratic Bézier curves, and OpenType
            fonts with Type 2 outlines only know cubic Bézier curves. So how do
            you draw a circle, or an ellipse, or an arc?
          </p>
          <p>You approximate.</p>
          <p>
            We already know that Bézier curves cannot model all curves that we
            can think of, and this includes perfect circles, as well as
            ellipses, and their arc counterparts. However, we can certainly
            approximate them to a degree that is visually acceptable. Quadratic
            and cubic curves offer us different curvature control, so in order
            to approximate a circle we will first need to figure out what the
            error is if we try to approximate arcs of increasing degree with
            quadratic and cubic curves, and where the coordinates even lie.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since arcs are mid-point-symmetrical, we need the control points to
            set up a symmetrical curve. For quadratic curves this means that the
            control point will be somewhere on a line that intersects the
            baseline at a right angle. And we don't get any choice on where that
            will be, since the derivatives at the start and end point have to
            line up, so our control point will lie at the intersection of the
            tangents at the start and end point.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, let's try to fit the quadratic curve onto a circular arc. In
            the following sketch you can move the mouse around over a unit
            circle, to see how well, or poorly, a quadratic curve can
            approximate the arc from (1,0) to where your mouse cursor is:

          />

          <p>
            As you can see, things go horribly wrong quite quickly; even trying
            to approximate a quarter circle using a quadratic curve is a bad
            idea. An eighth of a turns might look okay, but how okay is okay?
            Let's apply some maths and find out. What we're interested in is how
            far off our on-curve coordinates are with respect to a circular arc,
            given a specific start and end angle. We'll be looking at how much
            space there is between the circular arc, and the quadratic curve's
            midpoint.
          </p>
          <p>
            We start out with our start and end point, and for convenience we
            will place them on a unit circle (a circle around 0,0 with radius
            1), at some angle <em>φ</em>:

            width="175px"
            height="40px"
          />
          <p>
            What we want to find is the intersection of the tangents, so we want
            a point C such that:
          </p>
          <img

            height="40px"
          />
          <p>
            i.e. we want a point that lies on the vertical line through S (at
            some distance <em>a</em> from S) and also lies on the tangent line
            through E (at some distance <em>b</em> from E). Solving this gives
            us:
          </p>

            height="40px"
          />
          <p>First we solve for <em>b</em>:</p>

            width="560px"
            height="17px"
          />
          <p>which yields:</p>
          <img

            width="101px"
            height="39px"
          />
          <p>which we can then substitute in the expression for <em>a</em>:</p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"

            height="195px"
          />
          <p>
            A quick check shows that plugging these values for <em>a</em> and
            <em>b</em> into the expressions for C<sub>x</sub> and C<sub>y</sub>
            give the same x/y coordinates for both "<em>a</em> away from A" and
            "<em>b</em> away from B", so let's continue: now that we know the
            coordinate values for C, we know where our on-curve point T for
            <em>t=0.5</em> (or angle φ/2) is, because we can just evaluate the
            Bézier polynomial, and we know where the circle arc's actual point P
            is for angle φ/2:

            width="188px"
            height="32px"
          />
          <p>
            We compute T, observing that if <em>t=0.5</em>, the polynomial
            values (1-t)², 2(1-t)t, and t² are 0.25, 0.5, and 0.25 respectively:

            width="252px"
            height="35px"
          />
          <p>Which, worked out for the x and y components, gives:</p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"

            width="408px"
            height="77px"
          />
          <p>
            And the distance between these two is the standard Euclidean
            distance:
          </p>

            height="153px"
          />
          <p>
            So, what does this distance function look like when we plot it for a
            number of ranges for the angle φ, such as a half circle, quarter
            circle and eighth circle?

          <p>
            We now see why the eighth circle arc looks decent, but the quarter
            circle arc doesn't: an error of roughly 0.06 at <em>t=0.5</em> means
            we're 6% off the mark... we will already be off by one pixel on a
            circle with pixel radius 17. Any decent sized quarter circle arc,
            say with radius 100px, will be way off if approximated by a
            quadratic curve! For the eighth circle arc, however, the error is
            only roughly 0.003, or 0.3%, which explains why it looks so close to
            the actual eighth circle arc. In fact, if we want a truly tiny
            error, like 0.001, we'll have to contend with an angle of (rounded)
            0.593667, which equates to roughly 34 degrees. We'd need 11
            quadratic curves to form a full circle with that precision!
            (technically, 10 and ten seventeenth, but we can't do partial
            curves, so we have to round up). That's a whole lot of curves just
            to get a shape that can be drawn using a simple function!
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, let's flip the function around, so that if we plug in the
            precision error, labelled ε, we get back the maximum angle for that
            precision:
          </p>

          />
          <p>
            And frankly, things are starting to look a bit ridiculous at this
            point, we're doing way more maths than we've ever done, but
            thankfully this is as far as we need the maths to take us: If we
            plug in the precisions 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 and 0.0001 we get the
            radians values 1.748, 1.038, 0.594 and 0.3356; in degrees, that
            means we can cover roughly 100 degrees (requiring four curves), 59.5
            degrees (requiring six curves), 34 degrees (requiring 11 curves),
            and 19.2 degrees (requiring a whopping nineteen curves).
          </p>
          <p>
            The bottom line?
            <strong>Quadratic curves are kind of lousy</strong> if you want
            circular (or elliptical, which are circles that have been squashed
            in one dimension) curves. We can do better, even if it's just by
            raising the order of our curve once. So let's try the same thing for
            cubic curves.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="circles_cubic">
          <h1><a href="#circles_cubic">Circles and cubic Bézier curves</a></h1>
          <p>
            In the previous section we tried to approximate a circular arc with
            a quadratic curve, and it mostly made us unhappy. Cubic curves are
            much better suited to this task, so what do we need to do?
          </p>
          <p>
            For cubic curves, we basically want the curve to pass through three
            points on the circle: the start point, the mid point at "angle/2",
            and the end point at "angle". We then also need to make sure the
            control points are such that the start and end tangent lines line up
            with the circle's tangent lines at the start and end point.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first thing we can do is "guess" what the curve should look
            like, based on the previously outlined curve-through-three-points
            procedure. This will give use a curve with correct start, mid and
            end points, but possibly incorrect derivatives at the start and end,
            because the control points might not be in the right spot. We can
            then slide the control points along the lines that connect them to
            their respective end point, until they effect the corrected
            derivative at the start and end points. However, if you look back at
            the section on fitting curves through three points, the rules used
            were such that they optimized for a near perfect hemisphere, so
            using the same guess won't be all that useful: guessing the solution
            based on knowing the solution is not really guessing.
          </p>
          <p>
            So have a graphical look at a "bad" guess versus the true fit, where
            we'll be using the bad guess and the description in the second
            paragraph to derive the maths for the true fit:
          </p>
          <Graphic
            title="Cubic Bézier arc approximation"

            draw="{this.draw}"
            onMouseMove="{this.onMouseMove}"
          />

          <p>
            We see two curves here; in blue, our "guessed" curve and its control
            points, and in grey/black, the true curve fit, with proper control
            points that were shifted in, along line between our guessed control
            points, such that the derivatives at the start and end points are
            correct.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can already see that cubic curves are a lot better than quadratic
            curves, and don't look all that wrong until we go well past a
            quarter circle; ⅜th starts to hint at problems, and half a circle
            has an obvious "gap" between the real circle and the cubic
            approximation. Anything past that just looks plain ridiculous... but
            quarter curves actually look pretty okay!
          </p>
          <p>
            So, maths time again: how okay is "okay"? Let's apply some more
            maths to find out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike for the quadratic curve, we can't use <i>t=0.5</i> as our
            reference point because by its very nature it's one of the three
            points that are actually guaranteed to lie on the circular curve.
            Instead, we need a different <i>t</i> value. If we run some analysis
            on the curve we find that the actual <i>t</i> value at which the
            curve is furthest from what it should be is 0.211325 (rounded), but
            we don't know "why", since finding this value involves root-finding,
            and is nearly impossible to do symbolically without pages and pages
            of math just to express one of the possible solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            So instead of walking you through the derivation for that value,
            let's simply take that <i>t</i> value and see what the error is for
            circular arcs with an angle ranging from 0 to 2π:

            We see that cubic Bézier curves are much better when it comes to
            approximating circular arcs, with an error of less than 0.027 at the
            two "bulge" points for a quarter circle (which had an error of 0.06
            for quadratic curves at the mid point), and an error near 0.001 for
            an eighth of a circle, so we're getting less than half the error for
            a quarter circle, or: at a slightly lower error, we're getting twice
            the arc. This makes cubic curves quite useful!
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, the precision of a cubic curve at a quarter circle is
            considered "good enough" by so many people that it's generally
            considered "just fine" to use four cubic Bézier curves to fake a
            full circle when no circle primitives are available; generally,
            people won't notice that it's not a real circle unless you also
            happen to overlay an actual circle, so that the difference becomes
            obvious.
          </p>
          <p>
            So with the error analysis out of the way, how do we actually
            compute the coordinates needed to get that "true fit" cubic curve?
            The first observation is that we already know the start and end
            points, because they're the same as for the quadratic attempt:

            But we now need to find two control points, rather than one. If we
            want the derivatives at the start and end point to match the circle,
            then the first control point can only lie somewhere on the vertical
            line through S, and the second control point can only lie somewhere
            on the line tangent to point E, which means:

            Starting with this information, we slowly maths our way to success,
            but I won't lie: the maths for this is pretty trig-heavy, and it's
            easy to get lost if you remember (or know!) some of the core
            trigonometric identities, so if you just want to see the final
            result just skip past the next section!

          <div class="note">
            <h2>Let's do this thing.</h2>
            <p>
              Unlike for the quadratic case, we need some more information in
              order to compute <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, since they're no longer
              dependent variables. First, we observe that the curve is
              symmetrical, so whatever values we end up finding for C<sub
                >1</sub
              >
              will apply to C<sub>2</sub> as well (rotated along its tangent),
              so we'll focus on finding the location of C<sub>1</sub> only. So
              here's where we do something that you might not expect: we're
              going to ignore for a moment, because we're going to have a much
              easier time if we just solve this problem with geometry first,
              then move to calculus to solve a much simpler problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we look at the triangle that is formed between our starting
              point, or initial guess C<sub>1</sub> and our real C<sub>1</sub>,
              there's something funny going on: if we treat the line
              {start,guess} as our opposite side, the line {guess,real} as our
              adjacent side, with {start,real} our hypotenuse, then the angle
              for the corner hypotenuse/adjacent is half that of the arc we're
              covering. Try it: if you place the end point at a quarter circle
              (pi/2, or 90 degrees), the angle in our triangle is half a quarter
              (pi/4, or 45 degrees). With that knowledge, and a knowledge of
              what the length of any of our lines segments are (as a function),
              we can determine where our control points are, and thus have
              everything we need to find the error distance function. Of the
              three lines, the one we can easiest determine is {start,guess}, so
              let's find out what the guessed control point is. Again
              geometrically, because we have the benefit of an on-curve
              <i>t=0.5</i> value.
            </p>
            <p>
              The distance from our guessed point to the start point is exactly
              the same as the projection distance we looked at earlier. Using
              <i>t=0.5</i> as our point "B" in the "A,B,C" projection, then we
              know the length of the line segment {C,A}, since it's d<sub
                >1</sub
              >
              = {A,B} + d<sub>2</sub> = {B,C}:
            </p>

            />
            <p>
              So that just leaves us to find the distance from <i>t=0.5</i> to
              the baseline for an arbitrary angle φ, which is the distance from
              the centre of the circle to our <i>t=0.5</i> point, minus the
              distance from the centre to the line that runs from start point to
              end point. The first is the same as the point P we found for the
              quadratic curve:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"

              height="32px"
            />
            <p>
              And the distance from the origin to the line start/end is another
              application of angles, since the triangle {origin,start,C} has
              known angles, and two known sides. We can find the length of the
              line {origin,C}, which lets us trivially compute the coordinate
              for C:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"

              width="261px"
              height="67px"
            />
            <p>
              With the coordinate C, and knowledge of coordinate B, we can
              determine coordinate A, and get a vector that is identical to the
              vector {start,guess}:
            </p>
            <img
              class="LaTeX SVG"

              width="211px"
              height="47px"
            />
            <p>
              Which means we can now determine the distance {start,guessed},
              which is the same as the distance {C,A}, and use that to determine
              the vertical distance from our start point to our C<sub>1</sub>:
            </p>

              height="56px"
            />
            <p>
              And after this tedious detour to find the coordinate for
              C<sub>1</sub>, we can find C<sub>2</sub> fairly simply, since it's
              lies at distance -C<sub>1y</sub> along the end point's tangent:
            </p>
            <img

            />
            <p>
              And that's it, we have all four points now for an approximation of
              an arbitrary circular arc with angle φ.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            So, to recap, given an angle φ, the new control coordinates are:
          </p>
          <img

            height="40px"
          />
          <p>
            And, because the "quarter curve" special case comes up so incredibly
            often, let's look at what these new control points mean for the
            curve coordinates of a quarter curve, by simply filling in φ = π/2:

            height="33px"
          />

            Which, in decimal values, rounded to six significant digits, is:

            Of course, this is for a circle with radius 1, so if you have a
            different radius circle, simply multiply the coordinate by the
            radius you need. And then finally, forming a full curve is now a
            simple a matter of mirroring these coordinates about the origin:

          </h1>
          <p>
            Let's look at doing the exact opposite of the previous section:
            rather than approximating circular arc using Bézier curves, let's
            approximate Bézier curves using circular arcs.
          </p>
          <p>
            We already saw in the section on circle approximation that this will
            never yield a perfect equivalent, but sometimes you need circular
            arcs, such as when you're working with fabrication machinery, or
            simple vector languages that understand lines and circles, but not
            much else.
          </p>
          <p>
            The approach is fairly simple: pick a starting point on the curve,
            and pick two points that are further along the curve. Determine the
            circle that goes through those three points, and see if it fits the
            part of the curve we're trying to approximate. Decent fit? Try
            spacing the points further apart. Bad fit? Try spacing the points
            closer together. Keep doing this until you've found the "good
            approximation/bad approximation" boundary, record the "good" arc,
            and then move the starting point up to overlap the end point we
            previously found. Rinse and repeat until we've covered the entire
            curve.
          </p>
          <p>
            So: step 1, how do we find a circle through three points? That part
            is actually really simple. You may remember (if you ever learned
            it!) that a line between two points on a circle is called a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28geometry%29"
              >chord</a
            >, and one property of chords is that the line from the center of
            any chord, perpendicular to that chord, passes through the center of
            the circle.
          </p>
          <p>
            So: if we have have three points, we have three (different) chords,
            and consequently, three (different) lines that go from those chords
            through the center of the circle. So we find the centers of the
            chords, find the perpendicular lines, find the intersection of those
            lines, and thus find the center of the circle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following graphic shows this procedure with a different colour
            for each chord and its associated perpendicular through the center.
            You can move the points around as much as you like, those lines will
            always meet!
          </p>

            draw="{this.drawCircle}"
          />

          <p>
            So, with the procedure on how to find a circle through three points,
            finding the arc through those points is straight-forward: pick one
            of the three points as start point, pick another as an end point,
            and the arc has to necessarily go from the start point, over the
            remaining point, to the end point.
          </p>
          <p>
            So how can we convert a Bézier curve into a (sequence of) circular
            arc(s)?
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Start at <em>t=0</em></li>
            <li>
              Pick two points further down the curve at some value
              <em>m = t + n</em> and <em>e = t + 2n</em>
            </li>
            <li>Find the arc that these points define</li>
            <li>
              Determine how close the found arc is to the curve:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Pick two additional points <em>e1 = t + n/2</em> and
                  <em>e2 = t + n + n/2</em>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  These points, if the arc is a good approximation of the curve
                  interval chosen, should lie <em>on</em> the circle, so their
                  distance to the center of the circle should be the same as the
                  distance from any of the three other points to the center.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For point points, determine the (absolute) error between the
                  radius of the circle, and the <em>actual</em> distance from
                  the center of the circle to the point on the curve.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If this error is too high, we consider the arc bad, and try a
                  smaller interval.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The result of this is shown in the next graphic: we start at a
            guaranteed failure: s=0, e=1. That's the entire curve. The midpoint
            is simply at <em>t=0.5</em>, and then we start performing a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm"
              >Binary Search</a
            >.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>We start with {0, 0.5, 1}</li>
            <li>
              That'll fail, so we retry with the interval halved: {0, 0.25, 0.5}
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If that arc's good, we move back up by half distance: {0,
                  0.375, 0.75}.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, if the arc was still bad, we move <em>down</em> by
                  half the distance: {0, 0.125, 0.25}.
                </li>

              We keep doing this over and over until we have two arcs found in
              sequence of which the first arc is good, and the second arc is
              bad. When we find that pair, we've found the boundary between a
              good approximation and a bad approximation, and we pick the
              former.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The following graphic shows the result of this approach, with a
            default error threshold of 0.5, meaning that if an arc is off by a
            <em>combined</em> half pixel over both verification points, then we
            treat the arc as bad. This is an extremely simple error policy, but
            already works really well. Note that the graphic is still
            interactive, and you can use your up and down arrow keys keys to
            increase or decrease the error threshold, to see what the effect of
            a smaller or larger error threshold is.

            onKeyDown="{this.props.onKeyDown}"
          />

          <p>
            With that in place, all that's left now is to "restart" the
            procedure by treating the found arc's end point as the new
            to-be-determined arc's starting point, and using points further down
            the curve. We keep trying this until the found end point is for
            <em>t=1</em>, at which point we are done. Again, the following
            graphic allows for up and down arrow key input to increase or
            decrease the error threshold, so you can see how picking a different
            threshold changes the number of arcs that are necessary to
            reasonably approximate a curve:

            onKeyDown="{this.props.onKeyDown}"
          />

          <p>
            So... what is this good for? Obviously, if you're working with
            technologies that can't do curves, but can do lines and circles,
            then the answer is pretty straightforward, but what else? There are
            some reasons why you might need this technique: using circular arcs
            means you can determine whether a coordinate lies "on" your curve
            really easily (simply compute the distance to each circular arc
            center, and if any of those are close to the arc radii, at an angle
            between the arc start and end, bingo, this point can be treated as
            lying "on the curve"). Another benefit is that this approximation is
            "linear": you can almost trivially travel along the arcs at fixed
            speed. You can also trivially compute the arc length of the
            approximated curve (it's a bit like curve flattening). The only
            thing to bear in mind is that this is a lossy equivalence: things
            that you compute based on the approximation are guaranteed "off" by
            some small value, and depending on how much precision you need, arc
            approximation is either going to be super useful, or completely
            useless. It's up to you to decide which, based on your application!

          <h1><a href="#bsplines">B-Splines</a></h1>
          <p>
            No discussion on Bézier curves is complete without also giving
            mention of that other beast in the curve design space: B-Splines.
            Easily confused to mean Bézier splines, that's not actually what
            they are; they are "basis function" splines, which makes a lot of
            difference, and we'll be looking at those differences in this
            section. We're not going to dive as deep into B-Splines as we have
            for Bézier curves (that would be an entire primer on its own) but
            we'll be looking at how B-Splines work, what kind of maths is
            involved in computing them, and how to draw them based on a number
            of parameters that you can pick for individual B-Splines.
          </p>
          <p>
            First off: B-Splines are
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise"
              >piecewise polynomial interpolation curves</a
            >, where the "single curve" is built by performing polynomial
            interpolation over a set of points, using a sliding window of a
            fixed number of points. For instance, a "cubic" B-Spline defined by
            twelve points will have its curve built by evaluating the polynomial
            interpolation of four points, and the curve can be treated as a lot
            of different sections, each controlled by four points at a time,
            such that the full curve consists of smoothly connected sections
            defined by points {1,2,3,4}, {2,3,4,5}, ..., {8,9,10,11}, and
            finally {9,10,11,12}, for eight sections.
          </p>
          <p>
            What do they look like? They look like this! .. okay that's an empty
            graph, but simply click to place some point, with the stipulation
            that you need at least four point to see any curve. More than four
            points simply draws a longer B-Spline curve:
          </p>
          <BSplineGraphic sketch="{this.basicSketch}" />

          <p>
            The important part to notice here is that we are
            <strong>not</strong> doing the same thing with B-Splines that we do
            for poly-Béziers or Catmull-Rom curves: both of the latter simply
            define new sections as literally "new sections based on new points",
            so a 12 point cubic poly-Bézier curve is actually impossible,
            because we start with a four point curve, and then add three more
            points for each section that follows, so we can only have 4, 7, 10,
            13, 16, etc point Poly-Béziers. Similarly, while Catmull-Rom curves
            can grow by adding single points, this addition of a single point
            introduces three implicit Bézier points. Cubic B-Splines, on the
            other hand, are smooth interpolations of
            <em>each possible curve involving four consecutive points</em>, such
            that at any point along the curve except for our start and end
            points, our on-curve coordinate is defined by four control points.
          </p>
          <p>Consider the difference to be this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              for Bézier curves, the curve is defined as an interpolation of
              points, but:
            </li>
            <li>
              for B-Splines, the curve is defined as an interpolation of
              <em>curves</em>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In order to make this interpolation of curves work, the maths is
            necessarily more complex than the maths for Bézier curves, so let's
            have a look at how things work.
          </p>
          <h2>How to compute a B-Spline curve: some maths</h2>
          <p>
            Given a B-Spline of degree <code>d</code> and thus order
            <code>k=d+1</code> (so a quadratic B-Spline is degree 2 and order 3,
            a cubic B-Spline is degree 3 and order 4, etc) and
            <code>n</code> control points <code>P<sub>0</sub></code> through
            <code>P<sub>n-1</sub></code
            >, we can compute a point on the curve for some value
            <code>t</code> in the interval [0,1] (where 0 is the start of the
            curve, and 1 the end, just like for Bézier curves), by evaluating
            the following function:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/0f3451c711c0fe5d0b018aa4aa77d855.svg"
            width="169px"
            height="41px"
          />
          <p>
            Which, honestly, doesn't tell us all that much. All we can see is
            that a point on a B-Spline curve is defined as "a mix of all the
            control points, weighted somehow", where the weighting is achieved
            through the <em>N(...)</em> function, subscripted with an obvious
            parameter <code>i</code>, which comes from our summation, and some
            magical parameter <code>k</code>. So we need to know two things: 1.
            what does N(t) do, and 2. what is that <code>k</code>? Let's cover
            both, in reverse order.
          </p>
          <p>
            The parameter <code>k</code> represents the "knot interval" over
            which a section of curve is defined. As we learned earlier, a
            B-Spline curve is itself an interpoliation of curves, and we can
            treat each transition where a control point starts or stops
            influencing the total curvature as a "knot on the curve". Doing so
            for a degree <code>d</code> B-Spline with <code>n</code> control
            point gives us <code>d + n + 1</code> knots, defining
            <code>d + n</code> intervals along the curve, and it is these
            intervals that the above <code>k</code> subscript to the N()
            function applies to.
          </p>
          <p>Then the N() function itself. What does it look like?</p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/cf45d1ea00d4866abc8a058b130299b4.svg"
            width="559px"
            height="43px"
          />
          <p>
            So this is where we see the interpolation: N(t) for an (i,k) pair
            (that is, for a step in the above summation, on a specific knot
            interval) is a mix between N(t) for (i,k-1) and N(t) for (i+1,k-1),
            so we see that this is a recursive iteration where
            <code>i</code> goes up, and <code>k</code> goes down, so it seem
            reasonable to expect that this recursion has to stop at some point;
            obviously, it does, and specifically it does so for the following
            <code>i</code>/<code>k</code> values:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/adac18ea69cc58e01c8d5e15498e4aa6.svg"
            width="240px"
            height="40px"
          />
          <p>
            And this function finally has a straight up evaluation: if a
            <code>t</code> value lies within a knot-specific interval once we
            reach a <code>k=1</code> value, it "counts", otherwise it doesn't.
            We did cheat a little, though, because for all these values we need
            to scale our <code>t</code> value first, so that it lies in the
            interval bounded by <code>knots[d]</code> and <code>knots[n]</code>,
            which are the start point and end point where curvature is
            controlled by exactly <code>order</code> control points. For
            instance, for degree 3 (=order 4) and 7 control points, with knot
            vector [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], we map <code>t</code> from [the
            interval 0,1] to the interval [4,8], and then use that value in the
            functions above, instead.
          </p>
          <h2>Can we simplify that?</h2>
          <p>We can, yes.</p>
          <p>
            People far smarter than us have looked at this work, and two in
            particular —
            <a href="http://www.npl.co.uk/people/maurice-cox">Maurice Cox</a>
            and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_R._de_Boor"
              >Carl de Boor</a
            >
            — came to a mathematically pleasing solution: to compute a point
            P(t), we can compute this point by evaluating <em>d(t)</em> on a
            curve section between knots <em>i</em> and <em>i+1</em>:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/763838ea6f9e6c6aa63ea5f9c6d9542f.svg"
            width="281px"
            height="21px"
          />
          <p>
            This is another recursive function, with <em>k</em> values
            decreasing from the curve order to 1, and the value
            <em>α</em> (alpha) defined by:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/892209dad8fd1f839470dd061e870913.svg"
            width="255px"
            height="39px"
          />
          <p>
            That looks complicated, but it's not. Computing alpha is just a
            fraction involving known, plain numbers and once we have our alpha
            value, computing (1-alpha) is literally just "computing one minus
            alpha". Computing this d() function is thus simply a matter of
            "computing simple arithmetics but with recursion", which might be
            computationally expensive because we're doing "a lot of" steps, but
            is also computationally cheap because each step only involves very
            simple maths. Of course as before the recursion has to stop:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/4c8f9814c50c708757eeb5a68afabb7f.svg"
            width="368px"
            height="40px"
          />
          <p>
            So, we see two stopping conditions: either <code>i</code> becomes 0,
            in which case d() is zero, or <code>k</code> becomes zero, in which
            case we get the same "either 1 or 0" that we saw in the N() function
            above.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to Cox and de Boor, we can compute points on a B-Spline
            pretty easily: we just need to compute a triangle of interconnected
            values. For instance, d() for i=3, k=3 yields the following
            triangle:
          </p>
          <img
            class="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/7962d6fea86da6f53a7269fba30f0138.svg"
            width="417px"
            height="231px"
          />
          <p>
            That is, we compute d(3,3) as a mixture of d(2,3) and d(2,2): d(3,3)
            = a(3,3) x d(2,3) + (1-a(3,3)) x d(2,2)... and we simply keep
            expanding our triangle until we reach the terminating function
            parameters. Done deal!
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing we need to keep in mind is that we're working with a
            spline that is constrained by its control points, so even though the
            <code>d(..., k)</code> values are zero or one at the lowest level,
            they are really "zero or one, times their respective control point",
            so in the next section you'll see the algorithm for running through
            the computation in a way that starts with a copy of the control
            point vector and then works its way up to that single point: that's
            pretty essential!
          </p>
          <p>
            If we run this computation "down", starting at d(3,3), then without
            special code in place we would be computing quite a few terms
            multiple times at each step. On the other hand, we can also start
            with that last "column", we can generate the terminating d() values
            first, then compute the a() constants, perform our multiplications,
            generate the previous step's d() values, compute their a()
            constants, do the multiplications, etc. until we end up all the way
            back at the top. If we run our computation this way, we don't need
            any explicit caching, we can just "recycle" the list of numbers we
            start with and simply update them as we move up the triangle. So,
            let's implement that!
          </p>
          <h2>
            Cool, cool... but I don't know what to do with that information
          </h2>
          <p>
            I know, this is pretty mathy, so let's have a look at what happens
            when we change parameters here. We can't change the maths for the
            interpolation functions, so that gives us only one way to control
            what happens here: the knot vector itself. As such, let's look at
            the graph that shows the interpolation functions for a cubic
            B-Spline with seven points with a uniform knot vector (so we see
            seven identical functions), representing how much each point
            (represented by one function each) influences the total curvature,
            given our knot values. And, because exploration is the key to
            discovery, let's make the knot vector a thing we can actually
            manipulate. Normally a proper knot vector has a constraint that any
            value is strictly equal to, or larger than the previous ones, but
            screw it this is programming, let's ignore that hard restriction and
            just mess with the knots however we like.
          </p>
          <div class="two-column">
            <KnotController ref="interpolation-graph" />
            <BSplineGraphic sketch={this.interpolationGraph} controller={(owner,
            knots) => this.bindKnots(owner, knots, "interpolation-graph")}/>
          </div>

          <p>
            Changing the values in the knot vector changes how much each point
            influences the total curvature (with some clever knot value
            manipulation, we can even make the influence of certain points
            disappear entirely!), so we can see that while the control points
            define the hull inside of which we're going to be drawing a curve,
            it is actually the knot vector that determines the actual
            <em>shape</em> of the curve inside that hull.
          </p>
          <p>
            After reading the rest of this section you may want to come back
            here to try some specific knot vectors, and see if the resulting
            interpolation landscape makes sense given what you will now think
            should happen!
          </p>
          <h2>Running the computation</h2>
          <p>
            Unlike the de Casteljau algorithm, where the <code>t</code> value
            stays the same at every iteration, for B-Splines that is not the
            case, and so we end having to (for each point we evaluate) run a

          </p>
          <p>
            Given an input value <code>t</code>, we first map the input to a
            value from the domain [0,1] to the domain [knots[degree],
            knots[knots.length - 1 - degree]. Then, we find the section number
            <code>s</code> that this mapped <code>t</code> value lies on:
          </p>
          <pre><code>for(s=domain[0]; s &lt; domain[1]; s++) {
  if(knots[s] &lt;= t && t &lt;= knots[s+1]) break;
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            after running this code, <code>s</code> is the index for the section
            the point will lie on. We then run the algorithm mentioned on the MU
            page (updated to use this description's variable names):
          </p>
          <pre><code>let v = copy of control points

for(let L = 1; L &lt;= order; L++) {
  for(let i=s; i &gt; s + L - order; i--) {
    let numerator = t - knots[i]
    let denominator = knots[i - L + order] - knots[i]
    let alpha = numerator / denominator
    let v[i] = alpha * v[i] + (1-alpha) * v[i-1]
  }
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            (A nice bit of behaviour in this code is that we work the
            interpolation "backwards", starting at <code>i=s</code> at each
            level of the interpolation, and we stop when
            <code>i = s - order + level</code>, so we always end up with a value
            for <code>i</code> such that those <code>v[i-1]</code> don't try to
            use an array index that doesn't exist)
          </p>
          <h2>Open vs. closed paths</h2>
          <p>
            Much like poly-Béziers, B-Splines can be either open, running from
            the first point to the last point, or closed, where the first and
            last point are <em>the same point</em>. However, because B-Splines
            are an interpolation of curves, not just point, we can't simply make
            the first and last point the same, we need to link a few point
            point: for an order <code>d</code> B-Spline, we need to make the
            last <code>d</code> point the same as the first
            <code>d</code> points. And the easiest way to do this is to simply
            append <code>points.splice(0,d)</code> to <code>points</code>. Done!
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course if we want to manipulate these kind of curves we need to
            make sure to mark them as "closed" so that we know the coordinate
            for <code>points[0]</code> and <code>points[n-k]</code> etc. are the
            same coordinate, and manipulating one will equally manipulate the
            other, but programming generally makes this really easy by storing
            references to coordinates (or other linked values such as coordinate
            weights, discussed in the NURBS section) rather than separate
            coordinate objects.
          </p>
          <h2>Manipulating the curve through the knot vector</h2>
          <p>
            The most important thing to understand when it comes to B-Splines is
            that they work <em>because</em> of the concept of a knot vector. As
            mentioned above, knots represent "where individual control points
            start/stop influencing the curve", but we never looked at the
            <em>values</em> that go in the knot vector. If you look back at the
            N() and a() functions, you see that interpolations are based on
            intervals in the knot vector, rather than the actual values in the
            knot vector, and we can exploit this to do some pretty interesting
            things with clever manipulation of the knot vector. Specifically
            there are four things we can do that are worth looking at:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              we can use a uniform knot vector, with equally spaced intervals,
            </li>
            <li>
              we can use a non-uniform knot vector, without enforcing equally
              spaced intervals,
            </li>
            <li>
              we can collapse sequential knots to the same value, locally
              lowering curve complexity using "null" intervals, and
            </li>
            <li>
              we can form a special case non-uniform vector, by combining (1)
              and (3) to for a vector with collapsed start and end knots, with a
              uniform vector in between.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Uniform B-Splines</h3>
          <p>
            The most straightforward type of B-Spline is the uniform spline. In
            a uniform spline, the knots are distributed uniformly over the
            entire curve interval. For instance, if we have a knot vector of
            length twelve, then a uniform knot vector would be
            [0,1,2,3,...,9,10,11]. Or [4,5,6,...,13,14,15], which defines
            <em>the same intervals</em>, or even [0,2,3,...,18,20,22], which
            also defines <em>the same intervals</em>, just scaled by a constant
            factor, which becomes normalised during interpolation and so does
            not contribute to the curvature.
          </p>
          <div class="two-column">
            <KnotController ref="uniform-spline" />
            <BSplineGraphic sketch={this.uniformBSpline} controller={(owner,
            knots) => this.bindKnots(owner, knots, "uniform-spline")}/>
          </div>

          <p>
            This is an important point: the intervals that the knot vector
            defines are <em>relative</em> intervals, so it doesn't matter if
            every interval is size 1, or size 100 - the relative differences
            between the intervals is what shapes any particular curve.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem with uniform knot vectors is that, as we need
            <code>order</code> control points before we have any curve with
            which we can perform interpolation, the curve does not "start" at
            the first point, nor "ends" at the last point. Instead there are
            "gaps". We can get rid of these, by being clever about how we apply
            the following uniformity-breaking approach instead...
          </p>
          <h3>Reducing local curve complexity by collapsing intervals</h3>
          <p>
            By collapsing knot intervals by making two or more consecutive knots
            have the same value, we can reduce the curve complexity in the
            sections that are affected by the knots involved. This can have
            drastic effects: for every interval collapse, the curve order goes
            down, and curve continuity goes down, to the point where collapsing
            <code>order</code> knots creates a situation where all continuity is
            lost and the curve "kinks".
          </p>
          <div class="two-column">
            <KnotController ref="center-cut-bspline" />
            <BSplineGraphic sketch={this.centerCutBSpline} controller={(owner,
            knots) => this.bindKnots(owner, knots, "center-cut-bspline")}/>
          </div>

          <h3>Open-Uniform B-Splines</h3>
          <p>
            By combining knot interval collapsing at the start and end of the
            curve, with uniform knots in between, we can overcome the problem of
            the curve not starting and ending where we'd kind of like it to:
          </p>
          <p>
            For any curve of degree <code>D</code> with control points
            <code>N</code>, we can define a knot vector of length
            <code>N+D+1</code> in which the values <code>0 ... D+1</code> are
            the same, the values <code>D+1 ... N+1</code> follow the "uniform"
            pattern, and the values <code>N+1 ... N+D+1</code> are the same
            again. For example, a cubic B-Spline with 7 control points can have
            a knot vector [0,0,0,0,1,2,3,4,4,4,4], or it might have the
            "identical" knot vector [0,0,0,0,2,4,6,8,8,8,8], etc. Again, it is
            the relative differences that determine the curve shape.
          </p>
          <div class="two-column">
            <KnotController ref="open-uniform-bspline" />
            <BSplineGraphic sketch={this.openUniformBSpline} controller={(owner,
            knots) => this.bindKnots(owner, knots, "open-uniform-bspline")}/>
          </div>

          <h3>Non-uniform B-Splines</h3>
          <p>
            This is essentially the "free form" version of a B-Spline, and also
            the least interesting to look at, as without any specific reason to
            pick specific knot intervals, there is nothing particularly
            interesting going on. There is one constraint to the knot vector,
            and that is that any value <code>knots[k+1]</code> should be equal
            to, or greater than <code>knots[k]</code>.
          </p>
          <h2>One last thing: Rational B-Splines</h2>
          <p>
            While it is true that this section on B-Splines is running quite
            long already, there is one more thing we need to talk about, and
            that's "Rational" splines, where the rationality applies to the
            "ratio", or relative weights, of the control points themselves. By
            introducing a ratio vector with weights to apply to each control
            point, we greatly increase our influence over the final curve shape:
            the more weight a control point carries, the close to that point the
            spline curve will lie, a bit like turning up the gravity of a
            control point.
          </p>
          <div class="two-column">
            { // <KnotController ref="rational-uniform-bspline" />
            }
            <WeightController ref="rational-uniform-bspline-weights" />
            <BSplineGraphic scrolling={true}
            sketch={this.rationalUniformBSpline} controller={(owner, knots,
            weights, closed) => { // this.bindKnots(owner, knots,
            "rational-uniform-bspline"); this.bindWeights(owner, weights,
            closed, "rational-uniform-bspline-weights"); }} />
          </div>

          <p>
            Of course this brings us to the final topic that any text on
            B-Splines must touch on before calling it a day: the NURBS, or
            Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS is not a plural, the capital S
            actually just stands for "spline", but a lot of people mistakenly
            treat it as if it is, so now you know better). NURBS are an
            important type of curve in computer-facilitated design, used a lot
            in 3D modelling (as NURBS surfaces) as well as in
            arbitrary-precision 2D design due to the level of control a NURBS
            curve offers designers.
          </p>
          <p>
            While a true non-uniform rational B-Spline would be hard to work
            with, when we talk about NURBS we typically mean the Open-Uniform
            Rational B-Spline, or OURBS, but that doesn't roll off the tongue
            nearly as nicely, and so remember that when people talk about NURBS,
            they typically mean open-uniform, which has the useful property of
            starting the curve at the first control point, and ending it at the
            last.
          </p>
          <h2>Extending our implementation to cover rational splines</h2>
          <p>
            The algorithm for working with Rational B-Splines is virtually
            identical to the regular algorithm, and the extension to work in the
            control point weights is fairly simple: we extend each control point
            from a point in its original number of dimensions (2D, 3D, etc) to
            one dimension higher, scaling the original dimensions by the control
            point's weight, and then assigning that weight as its value for the
            extended dimension.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a 2D point <code>(x,y)</code> with weight
            <code>w</code> becomes a 3D point <code>(w * x, w * y, w)</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We then run the same algorithm as before, which will automatically
            perform weight interpolation in addition to regular coordinate
            interpolation, because all we've done is pretended we have
            coordinates in a higher dimension. The algorithm doesn't really care
            about how many dimensions it needs to interpolate.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to recover our "real" curve point, we take the final result
            of the point generation algorithm, and "unweigh" it: we take the
            final point's derived weight <code>w'</code> and divide all the
            regular coordinate dimensions by it, then throw away the weight
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on our previous example, we take the final 3D point
            <code>(x', y', w')</code>, which we then turn back into a 2D point
            by computing <code>(x'/w', y'/w')</code>. And that's it, we're done!
