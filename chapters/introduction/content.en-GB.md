# A lightning introduction

Let's start with the good stuff: when we're talking about Bézier curves, we're talking about the things that you can see in the following graphics. They run from some start point to some end point, with their curvature influenced by one or more "intermediate" control points. Now, because all the graphics on this page are interactive, go manipulate those curves a bit: click-drag the points, and see how their shape changes based on what you do.

<div class="figure">
  <graphics-element title="A quadratic Bézier curve" src="./quadratic.js"></graphics-element>
  <graphics-element title="A cubic Bézier curve" src="./cubic.js"></graphics-element>
</div>

These curves are used a lot in computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) applications, as well as in graphic design programs like Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, Inkscape, GIMP, etc. and in graphic technologies like scalable vector graphics (SVG) and OpenType fonts (TTF/OTF). A lot of things use Bézier curves, so if you want to learn more about them... prepare to get your learn on!
